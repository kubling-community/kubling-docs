# Kubling Metrics Dashboard

This is a simple dashboard showcasing metrics from Kubling itself.

Since Kubling does not store the history of metric values and only provides the current values, this example leverages TimescaleDB to maintain a historical record. 
TimescaleDB is configured as a data source in Kubling, and a scheduled script writes Kubling metrics into TimescaleDB every 30 seconds.

Superset is then configured with Kubling as its only data source. Superset pulls the history of metrics stored in TimescaleDB through Kubling, 
enabling rich visualization and analysis of historical metric data.

<Steps>

### Open Pre-Configured Dashboard
In the top menu, click on `Dashboards` and then select `Kubling Monitoring`.

</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  When collecting metrics, Superset establishes a new connection to Kubling for each chart. 
  As a result, you will notice the `kubling.login.total` metric increasing each time the dashboard is refreshed. This behavior is normal.
