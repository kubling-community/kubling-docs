# JDBC Native Driver

The Kubling [native protocol](/Concepts/architecture#transport) is based on RedHat's Teiid project, which is why you still see "teiid" in the connection string. 
We chose Teiid because it is a mature, rock-solid project that has proven its reliability. 
Additionally, the wiring layer, among others, is written in Java, making Teiid's transport implementation particularly suitable for our use case.

Both the Kubling native [protocol and its drivers](https://github.com/kubling-community/kubling-teiid-os/tree/master) are open-source and simple, 
meaning you can easily fork the project and write your own implementation if needed.

## Get the Driver
Drivers are regularly [published here](https://github.com/kubling-community/kubling-teiid-os/releases).

However, you can also add it via Maven dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.kubling</groupId>
    <artifactId>kubling-client</artifactId>
    <version>24.2.2</version>
</dependency>
```

## Connection
The main driver class is `com.kubling.teiid.jdbc.TeiidDriver`.

Connection URL:
```
jdbc:teiid:<vdb-name>[@mm[s]://<host>:<port>][;prop-name=prop-value]*
```

- `<vdb-name>`: Name of the VDB you are connecting to. 
Optionally VDB name can also contain version information inside it. For example: `myvdb.2`, 
this is equivalent to supplying the `version=2` connection property defined below.
However, use of vdb name in this format and the `version` property at the same time is not allowed.

- `mm`: defines the JDBC protocol, `mms` indicates a secure channel.

- `<host>`: Address of the Kubling instance. If you are using IPv6 binding address as the host name, place it in square brackets. ex:[::1]

- `<port>`: Post port on which the Kubling instance is listening for incoming **native** connections.

- `[prop-name=prop-value]`: Additionally you can supply any number of `property:value` pairs separated by semi-colon [`;`]. 
Property values should be URL encoded if they contain reserved characters, e.g. `’?’`, `'='`, `';'`, etc.

| `queryTimeout`              | `integer` | Query timeout in seconds. Must be >= `0`, while `0` indicates no timeout. Can be overridden by `Statement.setQueryTimeout`. Default `0`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `loginTimeout`              | `integer` | The login timeout in seconds. Must be >= `0`, while `0` indicates no specific timeout, but other timeouts may apply. If a connection cannot be created in approximately the `timeout` number of seconds, connection attempt will fail and the session closed by Kubling. A default value `0` does not mean that the login will wait indefinitely, instead it is up the Session Manager to close the sessions when in login (authentication) phase. |
| `reportAsViews`             | `boolean` | Indicates whether `DatabaseMetaData` must report views as `VIEW` table type. If `false` then views will be reported as `TABLE`. Default `true`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `connectionPropsFilePath`   | `string`  | Path to the **client** connection properties file, also known as client settings. These properties are related to networking and transport, so please do not confuse with connection string (URL) properties listed in this table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
