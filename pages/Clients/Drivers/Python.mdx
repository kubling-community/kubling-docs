# Connect from a Python Application

Since Kubling does not provide a Python driver for native protocol, PostgreSQL protocol must be used instead.

For python we do recommend the lightweight, pure-Python [pg8000](https://github.com/tlocke/pg8000/tree/main) driver.

Example:
```python
import pg8000

# Establish a connection
conn = pg8000.connect(
    host="localhost",
    port=35432,
    database="MyVDB",
    user="sa",
    password="sa",
    ssl_context=True
)

cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute("SELECT * from github.GITHUB_CODE_REPO_COLLABORATOR where repo in ('dbvirt-samples');")
allRows = cur.fetchall()

for allCols in allRows:
    for col in allCols:
        print(col)

cur.close()
conn.close()
```
