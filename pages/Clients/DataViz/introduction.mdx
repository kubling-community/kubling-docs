# Data Visualization with Kubling

Integrating Kubling with a Data Visualization tool unlocks powerful capabilities by addressing one of the most challenging aspects 
of comprehensive dashboards: managing and configuring multiple data sources.

Operational dashboards often involve aggregation and join logic to combine metrics, indicators, and trends. 
Traditionally, this requires integrating data from multiple sources or ingesting it into a single repository before analysis.

Kubling takes a different approach by providing a single virtual database that connects to multiple data sources directlyâ€”without requiring data ingestion. 
This approach allows for instant snapshots of system statuses, streamlining the process of building and maintaining operational dashboards.
