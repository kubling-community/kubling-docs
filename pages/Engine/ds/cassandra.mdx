# Cassandra Data Source (`CASSANDRA`) <Tag description={"v25.1+"} /> <Tag bgColor={"bg-kubling-dark-violet"} txtColor={"text-white"} description={"PREVIEW"} txtFont={"font-gilroyBold"} />

The **Cassandra** data source enables interaction with a **Cassandra cluster**.

While it shares similarities with other Kubling database data sources, it is **not** categorized under that group because:
- **Capabilities**: The supported query operations and optimizations differ from standard relational databases.
- **Translation Mechanism**: The internal query translation process requires a distinct approach for Cassandra.

Due to these differences, Cassandra is handled in Kubling as a separate data source type under the database datasource category.

<Callout type="warning">
  As of version `v25.1`, only `passthrough` mode is supported. This means that **custom DDL definitions are not yet available**. 
  We plan to introduce this capability in a future release, along with support for `synthetic` tables.

  However, you can still **define additional columns** through the schema configuration.
