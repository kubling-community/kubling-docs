# Cassandra Data Source (`CASSANDRA`) <Tag description={"v25.1+"} /> <Tag bgColor={"bg-kubling-dark-violet"} txtColor={"text-white"} description={"PREVIEW"} txtFont={"font-gilroyBold"} />

The **Cassandra** data source enables interaction with a **Cassandra cluster**.

While it shares similarities with other Kubling database data sources, it is **not** categorized under that group because:
- **Capabilities**: The supported query operations and optimizations differ from standard relational databases.
- **Translation Mechanism**: The internal query translation process requires a distinct approach for Cassandra.

Due to these differences, Cassandra is handled in Kubling as a separate data source type under the database datasource category.

<Callout type="warning">
  As of version `v25.1`, only `passthrough` mode is supported. This means that **custom DDL definitions are not yet available**. 
  We plan to introduce this capability in a future release, along with support for `synthetic` tables.

  However, you can still **define additional columns** through the schema configuration.

## Configuration example
```yaml copy
dataSources:
  - name: "cassandra"
    dataSourceType: "CASSANDRA"
    configObject:
      address: 127.0.0.1
      dataCenter: "datacenter1"
      keyspace: "test_keyspace"
      cache:
        enabled: false
        ttlSeconds: 43200
      allowBruteForceOperations: false
    schema:
      type: "PHYSICAL"
      cacheDefaultStrategy: "NO_CACHE"
```

## Using a DataStax Configuration File <Tag description={"v25.2+"} />

Kubling supports the use of a **DataStax configuration file** when connecting to a Cassandra cluster.

This allows for **advanced connection options**, such as:

- Custom load balancing policies
- SSL configurations
- Connection pooling and timeouts
- Retry and reconnection policies
- Authentication mechanisms

### Example

```yaml
dataSources:
  - name: "cassandra"
    dataSourceType: "CASSANDRA"
    configObject:
      datastaxConfigFilePath: "/etc/kubling/dse-driver.conf"
    schema:
      type: "PHYSICAL"
      cacheDefaultStrategy: "NO_CACHE"
```

> **Note:** The file must be accessible by the engine at runtime.

For more details about available options, see the official DataStax driver documentation:
