## Portable Local Data Source (`PORTABLE_LOCAL`) <Tag description={"v24.5.7+"} />

This **database data source** is based on the **H2 database engine**. It creates a **single-file, locally-stored database**.

The primary goal of this data source is to create lightweight, portable databases for storing **small amounts of information** that:

- Must persist across Kubling engine shutdowns.
- Can be shared with other Kubling instances or tools.

H2 was chosen over Kubling's internal small database engine (used for metadata storage) because it provides greater flexibility:

- You can open H2 databases using a wide variety of third-party tools.
- Accessing data does not depend on Kubling, making it easier to extract or view stored information independently.
- It allows you to treat this data source as any other regular remote data source.

[Check here](/schemas#portable-local-data-source-configuration) for the Portable Local Data Source configuration specification.

Sample configuration in VDB file:
```yaml
- name: mydb
  dataSourceType: PORTABLE_LOCAL
  configObject:
      dataSourceName: mydb-portable
      databaseName: mydb-portable
      userName: sa
      token: [REDACTED]
      maxConnectionPoolSize: 5
      minConnectionPoolSize: 1
      maxConnectionIdleMilliseconds: 7200000
      maxConnectionLifeTimeMilliseconds: 14400000
      cache:
        enabled: false
        ttlSeconds: 43200
      allowBruteForceOperations: false
      filePath: /some/path
      filePassword: [REDACTED]
      DDL: |
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS MyTable...
  schema:
      type: PHYSICAL
      properties:
        importer.schemaName: PUBLIC
        importer.useFullSchemaName: "false"
        importer.useCatalogName: "false"
        cacheDefaultStrategy: CACHE
```

### Limitations
As this data source is based on H2, some limitations apply. For more information, check [H2's official documentation](https://www.h2database.com/html/advanced.html#limits_limitations).

<Callout type='warning'>
  As per our test results, and to maintain optimal performance, we recommend keeping this data source under 1GB in size.
