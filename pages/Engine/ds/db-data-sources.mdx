# Introduction to Database Data Sources
When a new Database is added to the list of data sources, and no DDL is defined, the Kubling engine treats that data source as _passthrough_ (also called _direct_),
which has several implications on how the engine parses and resolves queries.

## Passtrough
Objects loaded in this mode come directly from the metadata read from the remote source during engine initialization. `SCHEMAs` and `TABLEs` are still
created in Kubling but serve only as a 1:1 mirror of the original `TABLEs` identified in the source.

This mode is useful when:
- A connection is needed to join existing information with `TABLEs` defined in Kubling.
- The source does not support complex custom functions, like Kublingâ€™s, and some transformations need to be applied **during query** via functions.
- Reducing load on the source, such as networking and cache storage, is beneficial.

### Queries
For query resolution in _passthrough_ mode, the engine pushes down as much as possible to the source, including functions and subqueries, relying on the
source's implementation. 

As a result, the query the source receives is almost identical to the one Kubling received.

In regular mode, however, the DQP resolves the AST differently. Subqueries may be resolved as independent units, resulting in multiple queries being sent to the data source.
<br/>

## Operations in Regular Mode (non _passthrough_)
When defining a `TABLE` in the DDL that enriches the original schema, CUD (Create, Update, Delete) operations are translated into a set of 
commands the data source can understand, particularly when the fields referenced in the commands are generated (i.e., they do not exist in the source).

Imagine we have a PostgreSQL instance with the following table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE itops.app_component (
	identifier varchar(36) NOT NULL,
	application_identifier varchar(255) NOT NULL,
	"name" varchar(255) NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT app_component_pkey PRIMARY KEY (identifier)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_app_component_search ON itops.app_component USING btree (name, application_identifier);
```

And we import it into Kubling as:
```sql
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE app_component
(
  -- matches with source 
  identifier string,
  application_identifier string,
  name string,

  -- extended fields
  ext_rnd string OPTIONS(call_func 'get_random<>'),
  ext_name string OPTIONS(call_func 'just_print_field<name>'),
  ext_combined string OPTIONS(call_func 'combine<identifier, name>'),
  n_identifier string NOT NULL OPTIONS(val_pk 'identifier+name' ),
  PRIMARY KEY(n_identifier),
  UNIQUE(identifier)        
) 
OPTIONS(updatable true, name_in_source 'itops.app_component');
```

Extended fields, as well as generated primary key (`val_pk`), are not pushed to the source since they exist only within Kubling's boundaries.

However, they can still be used in the `WHERE` clause of `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations. 
To identify the rows affected by these operations, the engine first fetches the rows matching the criteria (similar to a `SELECT`). 
It determines the appropriate strategy for this process as follows:

- `primary_key`: Used when the `TABLE` defines a primary key (PK) and the PK does not contain any generated fields.
- `unique_key`: Used when the `TABLE` defines a `UNIQUE` constraint and the fields involved do not include any generated fields.
- `brute_force`: A fallback option used when neither of the above strategies is applicable. This requires either:
  - `allowBruteForceOperations` to be enabled at the Data Source level, or
  - `allow_brute_force` to be enabled at the TABLE level.

<Callout type='info'>
  Defining a `TABLE` with the directive `name_in_source` is similar to naming the table using the full name. However, for the latter, when querying, you must enclose the name in quotes,
  like `SELECT * FROM pg."itops.app_component"`.

# Specific `TABLE` directives
Following directives work only in Database Data Sources
| Directive           | Type    | Options    | Description                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------|---------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name_in_source`    | String  | Any        | Indicates how the `TABLE` is named in the source, if it differs from Kubling's `TABLE`.                                                         |
| `allow_brute_force` | Boolean | True/False | Overrides the data source's decision to use brute force when the engine cannot find a way to identify affected rows in an `UPDATE` or `DELETE`. |

# Available Data Sources

## PostgreSQL Data Source (`POSTGRESQL`)
A Database Data Source that translates and adapts queriers to `POSTGRESQL`.

### Configuration
Uses the [Standard DB Data Source Configuration.](/schemas#standard-db-data-source-configuration)

Sample configuration in VDB file:
```yaml
- name: "app_db"
  dataSourceType: "POSTGRESQL"
  config: "bundle:datasource/psql-datasource.yaml"
  translatorConfig: "bundle:translator/base-translator-config.yaml"
  schema:
    type: "PHYSICAL"
    properties:
      'importer.useFullSchemaName': 'false'
      'importer.useCatalogName': 'false'
      'importer.schemaName': 'public'
```

When no DDL is defined and there are `importer` properties, the engine automatically creates all the `FOREIGN` tables that match the import strategy.<br/>
In this specific sample all the `TABLES` of the schema `PUBLIC` will have a local Kubling `TABLE`.


## MySQL Data Source (`MYSQL`)
Configuration is exactly the same as `POSTGRESQL` (above). Only difference is that `dataSourceType` must have the value `MYSQL`.
