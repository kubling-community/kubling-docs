# DDL

Kubling uses SQL-like DDL files to define `TABLEs`, which are organized within `SCHEMAs`. 
A `SCHEMA` serves as a container for metadata describing various objects, such as `TABLEs`, `VIEWs`, or `PROCEDUREs`.

Each `SCHEMA` is part of a Virtual Database (VDB), defined within the primary Descriptor bundle.

The real advantage of Kubling’s database virtualization engine lies in its flexibility: you can redefine the structure of `TABLEs` regardless of the underlying system’s actual model. 
This allows you to tailor data representations to your needs while still reflecting the source system's objects.

This flexibility is crucial for creating viewpoints tailored to specific data interactions, 
enabling you to adapt the data model to your needs rather than conforming to the system’s structure.

Additionally, Kubling allows the definition of `TABLEs` based on APIs, even those returning complex `JSON` documents. 
This capability simplifies working with deeply nested data structures, making it easier to transform them into a tabular format.

## Define a `TABLE`

```sql
CREATE TABLE {table-name} (
    <table-element> (,<table-element>)*
    (,<constraint>)*
) [OPTIONS (<options-clause>)]


<table-element> ::=
    {column-name} <data-type> <element-attr> <options-clause>

<data-type> ::=
    varchar | boolean | integer | double | date | timestamp .. (see Data Types)

<element-attr> ::=
    [AUTO_INCREMENT] [NOT NULL] [PRIMARY KEY] [UNIQUE] [INDEX] [DEFAULT {expr}]

<constraint> ::=
    CONSTRAINT {constraint-name} (
        PRIMARY KEY <columns> |
        FOREIGN KEY (<columns>) REFERENCES tbl (<columns>)
        UNIQUE <columns> |
        INDEX <columns>

<columns> ::=
    ( {column-name} [,{column-name}]* )

<options-clause> ::=
    <key> <value>[,<key>, <value>]*
```

### Sample
```sql
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE NAMESPACE
   (clusterName string OPTIONS(val_variable 'cluster_name'),
    clusterUrl string OPTIONS(val_constant '{{ schema.properties.kubernetes_api_url }}'),
    schema string OPTIONS(val_constant '{{ schema.name }}'),
    metadata__name string,
    metadata__labels json OPTIONS(parser_format 'asJsonPretty'),
    status__phase string,
    PRIMARY KEY(metadata__name),
    UNIQUE(clusterUrl, metadata__name))
OPTIONS(updatable true,
        supports_idempotency false,
        tags 'kubernetes;{{ schema.properties.cluster_name }};namespace');
```

<Callout type='info'>
  Double underscore in field name has a special meaning in the context of a Script Document Data Source. [See here for more information.](DDL#path-like-access)
</Callout>

## Options

<Callout type='warning'>
  Following options work ony in document data sources. However, we are implementing them also in non-document Adapters, like `POSTGRESQL`.<br/>

*Options* is the mechanism used by the Engine to pass meta-information from the `TABLE` definition to the query processor (QP).<br/>
Internally, each listed `OPTION` but `tags` is referred as `DIRECTIVE` since, as mentioned before, it can change the behavior of the QP

### Schema post-precessing in Document data sources

Suppose our data source interacts with the GitHub API, and we are retrieving a specific repository. GitHub’s response would be something like the following
```json

The challenge we face when translating a document schema into Kubling's Schema is handling nested fields.

Before diving into how to manage nested fields, it's important to note that while you can create a Kubling Schema that mirrors the entire document schema, 
it's generally not recommended. Most applications use only a subset of the data provided by upstream systems via their APIs. 
**Therefore, the design phase remains critical when implementing Kubling**.

When dealing with nested fields, there are three options: 
- Store the entire nested document in a `json` field.
- Use a path-like access naming convention.
- Ungroup fields into `synthetic` tables.

#### `json` field
A `json` field is treated by the engine as a nested document but behaves like any other regular field.

#### Path-like access
Suppose that you only need a couple of fields of `owner` rather than the entire nested document. 
When defining the `schema`, you can simply do the following:

```sql
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE CODE_REPO
(
    id long,
    name string,
    ...
    owner__login string,
    owner__html_url string,
    ...
) OPTIONS(...);
```
When a document-based adapter retrieves the information, the special double underscore character (`__`) is interpreted as a JSON path, equivalent to `.[field]`.
Essentially, it replaces the dot (`.`) typically used in path notation.

#### `synthetic` tables
`synthetic` are one of the most powerful features in Kubling because they allow the creation of tables that do not have a direct physical entity in the remote data source.

Continuing with this example, we can define a synthetic table called `CODE_REPO_OWNER` to represent the nested document, as shown below:

```sql
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE CODE_REPO_OWNER
(
    repoId long NOT NULL OPTIONS(synthetic_type 'parent', synthetic_parent_field 'id'),
    repoName long NOT NULL OPTIONS(synthetic_type 'parent', synthetic_parent_field 'name'),
    id long,
    node_id string,
    "login" string,
    html_url string,
    ...
    identifier string OPTIONS(val_pk 'repoId+id' ),
    PRIMARY KEY(identifier),
    UNIQUE(repoId, id)
) OPTIONS(
    synthetic_parent 'CODE_REPO',
    synthetic_path 'owner');
```

`CODE_REPO_OWNER` is a table derived from the `synthetic_path` field of `synthetic_parent`.
It includes two fields inherited from its parent, marked as `synthetic_type 'parent'`, and a generated identifier that also serves as the primary key. 

Additionally, we mark `repoId` and `id` as `UNIQUE`, ensuring that no other tuple will have the exact same combination of values.

The `UNIQUE` constraint plays an important role: when a Create, Update, or Delete (CUD) operation is performed on a `synthetic` table, 
the engine needs to trace the exact document lineage. It does this by relying on the combination of fields in the `UNIQUE` constraint.

##### Document arrays
When a field is an array of documents, the main difference is that the `synthetic` table will retrieve multiple rows for each parent document. 
However, you must ensure that the path built using the `UNIQUE` constraint leads to the exact element, 
meaning both the parent document(s) and the precise index or indices of the array.

##### `INSERT` on a `synthetic` table
Performing an `INSERT` on a synthetic table means that a new element must be added to the parent document's `synthetic_path`, whether it's a field or an array. 
The engine will create this new element based on the field values that are not associated with any `synthetic_type`. 
These values will then be used to trace the document lineage and identify the correct node where the new element should be inserted.

##### `UPDATE` on a `synthetic` table
Similar to `INSERT`, but instead of adding a new element (node), the values specified in the `SET` clause will replace an existing node.

##### `DELETE` on a `synthetic` table
Similar to `INSERT`, but after identifying the node, the engine removes it from the document.
