# Properties

Property injection is the standard mechanism for passing variables into a Kubling instance. 
As a general rule, when a property is defined in a more specific context, it overrides any values set in a broader context.<br/>

## Environment variables
They are the most basic mechanism for passing variables. All variables are picked up when the engine initializes and are available in all template contexts.

## Properties File
A properties file, similar to `.env` files, specified at the [Main application configuration](/schemas#main-application-configuration) 
level using the `propertiesFilePath`. This file overrides any environment variable properties.

However, itâ€™s important to note that variables defined in this file are not available during the parsing of the main application configuration itself.

The expected file format is as follows:
- Each entry is generally expected to be a single line of the form `key=value`. 
White space between the key and value is ignored, therefore `key = value` is equivalent.
- Lines starting with `#` are comments, therefore ignored.

## Data Source Properties
Properties passed in the [Virtual Database information file](/schemas#virtual-database-information-file-located-inside-the-descriptor-bundle), 
`dataSources.[data_source].properties` attribute.

Variables defined in this scope are available in Data Source configuration (`dataSources.[data_source].config`),
Translator configuration (`dataSources.[data_source].translatorConfig`), DDL (`dataSources.[data_source].schema.ddl`) 
and DDL Files (`dataSources.[data_source].schema.ddlFilePaths`).

It's important to note that Schema DDLs receive a special object in the context, called `schema`, which includes `dataSources.[data_source].schema`. 
If this object contains properties, they can be accessed via `schema.properties`. 
For example, you can refer to the [Built-in Kubernetes DDL](/data-sources#kubernetes-data-source-kubernetes) section for a practical use case. 
This approach enables reusability of common configuration files, such as `translatorConfig`, by isolating specific schema properties.


Properties specified in the Virtual Database (VDB) information file, defined using the `dataSources.[data_source].properties` attribute.

Variables defined at this level are accessible throughout the following configurations:

- Data Source Configuration (`dataSources.[data_source].config`)
- Translator Configuration (`dataSources.[data_source].translatorConfig`)
- Schema DDL (`dataSources.[data_source].schema.ddl`)
- DDL Files (`dataSources.[data_source].schema.ddlFilePaths`).

It's important to highlight that Schema DDLs are injected with a special context object named `schema`, which includes `dataSources.[data_source].schema`. 
If the `schema` object contains `properties`, they can be accessed via `schema.properties`. This enables flexibility and reusability, 
especially when working with shared configurations, such as `translatorConfig`. For an example, refer to the [Built-in Kubernetes DDL](/data-sources#kubernetes-data-source-kubernetes) section, 
which demonstrates a practical use case.
