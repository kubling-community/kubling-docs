# SQL Functions Bundle Module
This module contains functions that can be called in SQL contexts, like DDL.

Having all functions grouped in modules makes it easier to manage than putting them in each Script Bundle Module.

Let's see first the recommended internal directory and file organization:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.File name="bundle-sql-function-info.yaml" />  
  <FileTree.Folder name="fn">
    <FileTree.Folder name="azure">
        <FileTree.File name="sql_get_rg_from_id.js" />
        <FileTree.File name="sql_get_subscription_from_id.js" />
    </FileTree.Folder>    
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## ðŸ“„ `bundle-sql-function-info.yaml`
This is the only file whose location must be the root directory of the module.
See here the [schema](/schemas#sql-function-module-bundle-information-file-bundle-sql-function-infoyaml) of the file.

## ðŸ“‚ Platform-related functions directories
Ideally, a functions module should contain all the necessary functions for all the Data Sources. 
That is why it is highly recommended to keep them separate in directories.

<Callout type='info'>
  We are considering adding the ability to also define SQL functions within Script Bundle Modules.<br/>
  See [roadmap](/roadmap) for more info about it.  
</Callout>

## Naming Functions and Resolution
When a function module is referenced in the [descriptor bundle](/schemas#descriptor-bundle-information-file-bundle-infoyaml), it must have an associated module name, which is part of the fully qualified function name.

If the function name is unique across all modules, you can call the function without using the module name. However, if the function name is duplicated, you must use the module name. Otherwise, the function resolution process will fail due to an ambiguous name.

The fully qualified function name follows the format:  
`[module-name].[function-name]<params...>`

Example:
```sql
... OPTIONS(call_func 'azure_mod.az_sql_get_rg<id>')
```

## Function script
Kubling does not evaluate functions the same way it evaluates Delegate scripts, in the sense that in functions only the function code is loaded and evaluated,
not the whole script file, and the following limitations apply:<br/>
- `import` is not supported.
- Calling other functions is not supported.

Let's break down the following example:

```js
function sql_get_rg(args) {
    if ((args.value === null) || (args.value === undefined)) return null;
    return args.value.id.split("/")[4];
}
```

That simple functions receives an Azure ID (column `id`), and returns the Resource Group, which is located in the fourth position of the FQN.

The argument passed to functions is always one `args`, which is a KV with three members:
- `value`: An object whose members are the parameter column names. Its general form is `args.value.[col_name]`
- `column`: The name of the column, always referring to the TABLE column name this function in being applied to. When used with a different column name, 
such as `sql_get_rg<SOME>`, the column will not take that name and will always remain associated with the original field to which this function is applied.
- `datatype`: Column's data type.

The function can be used, for example, when defining a `TABLE`, as follows:
```sql
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE AZ_STORAGE_ACCOUNT
(
    subscription string OPTIONS(val_constant '{{ schema.properties.azure_subscription }}'),
    resourceGroup string OPTIONS(call_func 'az_sql_get_rg<id>'),
    sku json OPTIONS(parser_format 'asJsonPretty'),
    kind string,
    "identity" string,
    properties json OPTIONS(parser_format 'asJsonPretty'),
    tags json OPTIONS(parser_format 'asJsonPretty'),
    location string,
    "id" string,
    name string,
    type string,
    properties__provisioningState string,
    properties__accessTier string,
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
)
OPTIONS(updatable true,
        supports_idempotency false,
        tags 'azure;{{ schema.properties.azure_subscription }};storage;account');
```

In which case `resourceGroup` will contain the value returned by the function.

### Performance
Bear in mind that functions have a limited number of contexts, configurable via `partitions`, `minContexts` and `maxContexts` in `bundle-sql-function-info.yaml` configuration file,
and each context can execute one function at a time. If the Engine receives a `SELECT resourceGroup FROM AZ_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` that returns, let's say, 100 rows,
the `sql_get_rg` will be called, as you guessed, 100 times, likely generating queues. 

Therefore, it is important to keep functions as simple as possible, with basic transformations, and to avoid putting a lot of logic into them.
