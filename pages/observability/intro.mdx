# Observability

Kubling, as any other well-designed modern application, structures its observability around the three major pillars of instrumentation:

1. **Logs** – Detailed, timestamped records of events that occur within the system.
2. **Metrics** – Numerical indicators representing system behavior over time (e.g., memory usage, request rates).
3. **Traces** – Contextual data showing the lifecycle of requests or operations across distributed components.

This separation allows operators and developers to reason clearly about system behavior, troubleshoot issues, and extract insights from different layers — from high-level service health to low-level execution paths.

## OpenTelemetry

As of version `25.6`, Kubling fully adopted [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) as the foundation for its observability stack. This decision brings several advantages:

- **Standardization**: OpenTelemetry is supported by most major observability and APM platforms (e.g., Grafana, Prometheus, DataDog, New Relic, etc.).
- **Vendor-neutral**: You can export metrics, logs, and traces to any compatible system — either directly or through an intermediate [collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/).
- **Unified configuration**: Logs, metrics, and traces are now configured in a cohesive way, making it easier to reason about instrumentation.

## Configuration

Observability is configured at the [application level](/schemas#main-application-configuration) under the `instrumentation` section, with enough flexibility to support a wide range of use cases.

Each observability pillar (logs, metrics, traces) has its own configuration section, which you'll find detailed throughout this documentation. However, there are some **shared OpenTelemetry attributes** that apply globally across all telemetry data. These are configured under the `openTelemetryCommonAttributes` element and are strongly recommended for environments with multiple services, clusters, or deployment contexts.

### `openTelemetryCommonAttributes`

This section lets you explicitly define core metadata that will be attached automatically to **all logs, metrics, and traces** emitted by Kubling. These attributes follow [OpenTelemetry semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/) and are used by most observability platforms to group, filter, and explore telemetry.

| Attribute          | Type   | Description                                                                                         | Default Value                                                                                       | Example                        |
|--------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `serviceName`      | string | Logical name of the service emitting telemetry. Identifies the origin of logs, metrics, and traces. | `"kubling"`                                                                                         | `"kubling"`                    |
| `serviceNamespace` | string | Namespace used to logically group related services (e.g. by project, location, or purpose).         | `"kubling"`                                                                                         | `"kai-mad-1"` or `"dcim"`      |
| `serviceInstance`  | string | Unique identifier for this specific service instance (e.g. container ID, hostname, or device ID).   | If not defined, Kubling uses the engine `instanceName`, which defaults to a random string if unset. | `"node-123"` or `"switch-47"`  |
| `environment`      | string | Logical deployment environment of the service. Useful for filtering by lifecycle stage.             | –                                                                                                   | `"dev"`, `"staging"`, `"prod"` |

When configured, these values are automatically injected into:

- **Trace spans** (as span attributes like `service.name`, `service.namespace`, etc.)
- **Metrics** (as resource attributes in OTLP exporters)
- **Logs** (when using structured logging format)

Next, head over to the corresponding sections to configure:
- [Logs](/observability/logs)
- [Metrics](/observability/metrics)
- [Tracing](/observability/tracing)
