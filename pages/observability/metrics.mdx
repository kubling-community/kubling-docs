# Health Endpoint

The health endpoint indicates whether the engine is `UP` or `DOWN`.

The engine is considered `UP` when all its critical modules respond positively to a health check, indicating that:

- Clients can connect to the engine via any of the supported protocols.
- Soft transactions can be processed (if enabled).
- Adapters can establish connections with remote data sources.

The last point has a special meaning: if a data source is unreachable, the overall health of the engine is reported as `DOWN`.

Health status is particularly important not only for monitoring Kubling instances but also for integrating Kubling into complex pipelines, 
as it provides a mechanism to check readiness before proceeding with the next steps.

Health Check Endpoint:
```http
GET http[s]://[address]:8282/observe/health
```

## Contributors <Tag description={"v25.3.1+"} />

By default, data sources' adapters contribute to overall health. However, that option can be disabled to provide the flexibility and granularity needed to determine whether an unreachable remote data source should impact the engine's health status.

You can configure this behavior using the `contributesToHealth` property in each data source.  
For more information, please see the [configuration schemas](/schemas).

# Metrics

Kubling provides a set of metrics that can be integrated into your observability stack. 
We prioritize offering a concise, meaningful set of metrics that provide accurate insights rather than overwhelming you with an extensive list of 
unhelpful metrics that could unnecessarily consume system resources, particularly CPU.

<Callout>
    There could be use cases we are not aware of, in which case we encourage you to open an issue and make the request or to communicate with us using
    any of the available channels.
</Callout>

## Metrics Format
By default, Kubling provides metrics in a base standard format. 
While this format may not be directly compatible with most observability stacks, Kubling adapts these base metrics to other widely used formats to ensure compatibility. 
Importantly, the underlying metrics remain unchanged; only the presentation is adapted for the specific monitoring tool or format. 

This documentation focuses on the default format because it is easier to read and provides a clear view of the metricsâ€™ structure. 
Despite the formatting changes, the metrics' core data and meaning remain consistent across all formats.

Current support formats are Prometheus and Azure Monitor.

## Metrics endpoint
Metrics list can be fetch from `GET` `http[s]://[address]:8282/observe/metrics`<br/>
Each metric's measurement and tags can be fetch from `GET` `http[s]://[address]:8282/observe/metrics/[metric_name]`

## Engine related metrics

### `kubling.engine.sql.sessions.active` <Tag description={"Gauge"} />
Provides the number of current active SQL Sessions (Native & PG transports).

### `kubling.engine.sql.plan.active` <Tag description={"Gauge"} />
Number of current active SQL atomic plans. Atomic plans are effective work items within the DQP, that is, once the DQP identified the Data Sources involved in the query.

### `kubling.engine.sql.plan.enqueued.current` <Tag description={"Gauge"} />
Number of current Jobs (queries sent by any valid session) waiting for a free thread to process the plan.

### `kubling.engine.sql.plan.enqueued.max` <Tag description={"Gauge"} /> <Tag description={"v24.5.5+"} />
The maximum number of execution plans that were in the queue, waiting for a free thread, at any point during the current execution.

### `kubling.engine.sql.threads.active` <Tag description={"Gauge"} />
Number of current active SQL related threads, like DQP's plan processing. Take into account that one query may trigger multiple threads, one per atomic plan.

### `kubling.engine.sql.jobs.total` <Tag description={"Gauge"} />
Number of total submitted SQL Jobs.

### `kubling.engine.sql.jobs.completed` <Tag description={"Gauge"} />
Number of total completed SQL Jobs.

### `kubling.engine.sql.jobs.enqueued` <Tag description={"Gauge"} />
Number of current enqueued SQL Jobs.

### `kubling.engine.sql.jobs.max` <Tag description={"Gauge"} />
Maximum number of SQL jobs running in parallel during the current execution.

### `kubling.engine.sql.jobs.enqueued.max` <Tag description={"Gauge"} />
Maximum number of SQL jobs enqueued during the current execution.

### `kubling.nw.inbound.total` <Tag description={"Counter"} /> <Tag description={"v25.4+"} />
Total number of inbound network bytes received since the current instance started.
This is a per-transport metric. Use the attached tags (`transport=native` and `transport=pg`) to determine which transport the value refers to.

### `kubling.nw.outbound.total` <Tag description={"Counter"} /> <Tag description={"v25.4+"} />
Total number of outbound network bytes sent since the current instance started.
As with inbound metrics, this is collected per transport. Use the `transport` tag to filter and attribute usage correctly.


## JavaScript related metrics

### `kubling.js.threads.active` <Tag description={"Gauge"} />
Provides the number of current active JavaScript context threads.

### `kubling.js.executions` <span class="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-gray-50 px-2 py-1 text-sm font-medium text-gray-600 ring-1 ring-inset ring-gray-500/10 font-gilroyMedium">Counter</span>
Provides the number of total JavaScript context threads claimed during current execution.

### `kubling.js.auth.thread.active` <Tag description={"Gauge"} />
Provides the number of current active JavaScript Auth* context threads. Same measurement as `kubling.js.threads.active`.

### `kubling.js.auth.executions` <Tag description={"Counter"} />
Provides the number of total JavaScript Auth* context threads claimed during current execution. Same measurement as `kubling.js.executions`.

## Cache related metrics <Tag description={"v24.5.3+"} />

### `kubling.cache.request.count` <Tag description={"Counter"} />
Number of times the Engine requested for a Cache.

### `kubling.cache.entries.current` <Tag description={"Gauge"} />
Current cached result sets.

### `kubling.cache.hit.count` <Tag description={"Counter"} />
Number of times the Engine requested for a Cache and lookup methods have returned a cached value.

### `kubling.cache.hit.ratio` <Tag description={"Gauge"} />
Ratio of cache requests which were hits.

### `kubling.cache.mem.usage` <Tag description={"Gauge"} />
Total memory usage in Megabytes.

<Callout type='info'>
    Metrics come with without any tags by default. You can specify yours in the `metricsCommonTags` attribute of the [Main application configuration](/schemas#main-application-configuration).
</Callout>

## Prometheus
The metrics mentioned above are automatically adapted to [Prometheus format](https://github.com/prometheus/docs/blob/main/content/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats.md).<br/>
Metrics in this format can be obtained from `GET` `http[s]://[address]:8282/observe/prometheus`

<Callout>
    Bear in mind that Kubling does not push Prometheus metrics, since Prometheus uses a pull-based model for monitoring, 
    that is, the server pulls metrics from configured targets by scraping their endpoints which is, from the Kubling Engine stand pot of view, the preferred option.
</Callout>

## Azure Monitor
Metrics can be **pushed** to Azure Monitor using a built-in client. To activate it, you only need to pass an Application Insights instrumentation key via
`INST_AZ_MON_KEY` environment variable.

See [the official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) for more information about Application Insights.
