## Health Endpoint

The health endpoint indicates whether the engine is `UP` or `DOWN`.

The engine is considered `UP` when all its critical modules respond positively to a health check, indicating that:

- Clients can connect to the engine via any of the supported protocols.
- Soft transactions can be processed (if enabled).
- Adapters can establish connections with remote data sources.

The last point has a special meaning: if a data source is unreachable, the overall health of the engine is reported as `DOWN`.

Health status is particularly important not only for monitoring Kubling instances but also for integrating Kubling into complex pipelines, 
as it provides a mechanism to check readiness before proceeding with the next steps.

Health Check Endpoint:
```http
GET http[s]://[address]:8282/observe/health
```

## Contributors <Tag description={"v25.3.1+"} />

By default, data sources' adapters contribute to overall health. However, that option can be disabled to provide the flexibility and granularity needed to determine whether an unreachable remote data source should impact the engine's health status.

You can configure this behavior using the `contributesToHealth` property in each data source.  
For more information, please see the [configuration schemas](/schemas).

# Metrics

Kubling provides a set of metrics that can be integrated into your observability stack. 
We prioritize offering a concise, meaningful set of metrics that provide accurate insights rather than overwhelming you with an extensive list of 
unhelpful metrics that could unnecessarily consume system resources, particularly CPU.

<Callout>
    There could be use cases we are not aware of, in which case we encourage you to open an issue and make the request or to communicate with us using
    any of the available channels.
</Callout>

## Metrics Format
By default, Kubling provides metrics in a base standard format. 
While this format may not be directly compatible with most observability stacks, Kubling adapts these base metrics to other widely used formats to ensure compatibility. 
Importantly, the underlying metrics remain unchanged; only the presentation is adapted for the specific monitoring tool or format. 

This documentation focuses on the default format because it is easier to read and provides a clear view of the metrics’ structure. 
Despite the formatting changes, the metrics' core data and meaning remain consistent across all formats.

Current support formats are Prometheus and Azure Monitor.

## Metrics endpoint
Metrics list can be fetch from `GET` `http[s]://[address]:8282/observe/metrics`<br/>
Each metric's measurement and tags can be fetch from `GET` `http[s]://[address]:8282/observe/metrics/[metric_name]`

Provides the number of current active SQL Sessions (Native & PG transports).

### `kubling.engine.sql.plan.active` <Tag description={"Gauge"} />

### `kubling.engine.sql.plan.enqueued.current` <Tag description={"Gauge"} />
Number of current Jobs (queries sent by any valid session) waiting for a free thread to process the plan.

### `kubling.engine.sql.plan.enqueued.max` <Tag description={"Gauge"} /> <Tag description={"v24.5.5+"} />
The maximum number of execution plans that were in the queue, waiting for a free thread, at any point during the current execution.

### `kubling.engine.sql.threads.active` <Tag description={"Gauge"} />
Number of current active SQL related threads, like DQP's plan processing. Take into account that one query may trigger multiple threads, one per atomic plan.

### `kubling.nw.outbound.total` <Tag description={"Counter"} /> <Tag description={"v25.4+"} />
Total number of outbound network bytes sent since the current instance started.
As with inbound metrics, this is collected per transport. Use the `transport` tag to filter and attribute usage correctly.

Provides the number of total JavaScript context threads claimed during current execution.

### `kubling.js.auth.thread.active` <Tag description={"Gauge"} />

Total memory usage in Megabytes.

<Callout type='info'>
    Metrics come with without any tags by default. You can specify yours in the `metricsCommonTags` attribute of the [Main application configuration](/schemas#main-application-configuration).
</Callout>

## Prometheus
The metrics mentioned above are automatically adapted to [Prometheus format](https://github.com/prometheus/docs/blob/main/content/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats.md).<br/>
Metrics in this format can be obtained from `GET` `http[s]://[address]:8282/observe/prometheus`

<Callout>
    Bear in mind that Kubling does not push Prometheus metrics, since Prometheus uses a pull-based model for monitoring, 
    that is, the server pulls metrics from configured targets by scraping their endpoints which is, from the Kubling Engine stand pot of view, the preferred option.
</Callout>

## OpenTelemetry <Tag description={"v25.5+"} />

Kubling encourages the use of **OpenTelemetry** for metric collection, as its format is supported by nearly all modern monitoring platforms.  
If your provider does not support the OTLP protocol natively, you can always use an intermediate [collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/).

This approach keeps the Kubling binary lightweight. Adding native support for every monitoring tool would unnecessarily bloat the final binary size.

Enabling OpenTelemetry is straightforward. In your main application configuration, simply enable it like so:

```yaml
instrumentation:
  metrics:
    openTelemetry:
      enabled: true
      # Example for New Relic
      url: "https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net/v1/metrics"
      headers:
        api-key: "abc..."
```

The configuration is flexible enough to support most providers, with the ability to define custom HTTP headers for the requests.

## DataDog <Tag description={"v25.5+"} />

Due to its widespread adoption, DataDog is also supported via a native embedded exporter.
Configuration is simple and minimal:

```yaml
instrumentation:
  metrics:
    dataDog:
      enabled: true
      apiKey: 'abc...'
      url: https://app.datadoghq.eu
```

## Azure Monitoring <Tag description={"DEPRECATED"} />

<Callout type='warning'>
  Starting from version `25.5`, the configuration schema for instrumentation has changed.  
  As a result, environment variables like `INST_AZ_MON_KEY` have been **deprecated** in favor of a more expressive and structured configuration approach.  
  Please refer to the [main application configuration](/schemas#main-application-configuration) for details.
</Callout>

It is still possible to enable the native **Azure Monitor** exporter, although it is **deprecated** and will be removed in a future release.

The configuration mechanism has changed in version `25.5`, and now lives under the `instrumentation` section of the main application configuration:

```yaml
instrumentation:
  metrics:
    azureMonitor:
      enabled: true
      connectionString: ...
```
<Callout type="warning"> This exporter is no longer maintained and is scheduled for removal. Consider migrating to <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> for future compatibility. </Callout>
