# Versioning
Starting from version `25.1`, Kubling follows a three-segment versioning system:

- **Year**: Represents the release year. Internally, this helps structure product backlogs by year.
- **Release**: An incrementing number starting from `1` for each year's first release.
- **Fix** _(optional)_: An incrementing number starting from `1`, indicating a fix or patch for a specific release.

## Examples:
- **`25.1`** → First release of 2025.
- **`25.1.21`** → First release of 2025, with the 21st fix applied.

While fixes typically do not introduce new features, they may include minor enhancements if necessary to resolve existing issues.
