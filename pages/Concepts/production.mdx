# Production Instances

When deploying Kubling in production, consider the following best practices:

- Treat your instances as **immutable**, meaning no internal aspects of the instance should be changed once it is running.
- **Disable** the embedded web console.
- **Disable** the restart endpoint.
- Enable only the transports that you know will be actively used.
- **Enable communication security** by generating certificates (ideally through an automated pipeline). Certificates should have a maximum validity of 180 days.
- Mount a **separate volume for the buffer** and configure the buffer directory to point to that volume.
- **Never disable buffer encryption** when using disk storage.
- **Monitor your instances** by collecting or sending metrics from Kubling instances to your monitoring system.

## Upgrading Versions

When upgrading to a new Kubling version, always run all your tests before upgrading the production environment. Use the latest CLI version to perform these tests.

This is critical because the CLI shares certain Engine components, and any changes are released together (CLI and Engine).
If your code requires adaptations to the newer version, you can identify them by carefully inspecting the test outputs.
