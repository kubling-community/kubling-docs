## CLI
The Kubling CLI (Command Line Interface) is a single, statically compiled, dependency-free executable, named `kdv`. 

The main goal of the CLI is to facilitate common tasks required when configuring instances. 
It is designed to be easily embedded into pipelines, as well as into developers' environments.

### A note on its size
Although Kubling is not a heavy application (its OCI Image is \~125MB), and its Community Edition (CE) version includes nearly all the features needed during 
development—making it a perfect fit for local development environments—certain tasks like testing can be challenging and time-consuming 
if every small change to a Script Module requires restarting a test container.

On the other hand, CLI tools and packages are typically small, often just a few KB in size, especially in the Linux ecosystem. 
However, the first thing you'll notice is that `kdv` is relatively large compared to other CLI tools. 

This is because `kdv` contains roughly half of the packages and dependencies used by the server itself, 
including the Query Engine, Data Sources layer, including translators and adapters, and the JavaScript interpreter.

The reason for embedding all these packages into the CLI is that we have created a special test command, which helps you write and execute integration tests declaratively. 
This is part of our effort to integrate with popular IDEs like Visual Studio Code.

<Callout type="info">
  We are planning to release a smaller version without testing related commands.
  See our [roadmap](/roadmap) for more information.

## Distribution
For local development environments we recommend using the binary file whose distribution channel is still under development.

In pipelines, workflows or in case you prefer using containers, you can [find them here](https://hub.docker.com/r/kubling/dbvirt-cli/tags).

## Commands

### &bull; `bundle`
It aggregates various utilities for working with bundle files, like Modules.

#### Subcommands
#### &rarr; `genmod`
Generates a JavaScript Module file.

| <div style={{width: "120px"}}>Name</div> | Type         | Description                                                               | Default Value |
|------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Directory Path                           | Parameter(0) | Path to the root of the directory containing Module's code.               |               |
| -o, --output                             | Option       | Full file name of the generated bundle zip file.                          |               |
| -p, --parse                              | Option       | When enabled, all JavaScript files are parsed before bundle is generated. | `false`       |

Sample usage:
```sh
kdv bundle genmod /dbvirt-samples/azure/modules/delegate -o /dbvirt-samples/azure/modules/azure-module-bundle.zip --parse
```

### &bull; `test`
Utilities for performing tests.

#### Subcommands
#### &rarr; `integration`
Runs an Integration test plan.

| Name         | Type         | Description                    | Default Value |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------------|---------------|
| File Path    | Parameter(0) | Test plan manifest file path.  |               |

Sample usage:
```sh
kdv test integration /dbvirt-samples/appmodel/integration-test-plan.yaml
```

More about the test framework in the [next section](/CLI/test-framework).

### &bull; `cert`
Utilities for working with Kubling Server and Client certificates.

#### Subcommands
#### &rarr; `create`
Creates a pair of certificate stores to use in Server and Client.

KeyStore type used during generation is `PKCS12`, whereas for the digital signature, the `SHA512withRSA` encryption is used.

| <div style={{width: "120px"}}>Name</div> | Type   | Description                                                     | Default Value   |
|------------------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| -v, --validity                           | Option | SERVER and CLIENT certificate store validity expressed in days. | 180             |
| -s, --server                             | Option | Full file name of the generated SERVER certificate store.       | ./server.ks     |
| -c, --client                             | Option | Full file name of the generated CLIENT certificate store.       | ./client.ks     |
| -p, --clientPass                         | Option | CLIENT certificate store password.                              | (Random String) |
| -x, --serverPass                         | Option | SERVER certificate store password.                              | (Random String) |
| -o, --overwrite                          | Option | Overwrite store files if they already exist.                    | `false`         |

Sample usage:
```sh
kdv cert create -s /certs/server.ks -c /certs/client.ks -x myserverpass -p myclientpass -o
```

## Using the containerized version
The general usage, assuming you use Docker, is as follows:
```sh
docker run --rm -v [/your/project/path]:[/path/in/container] kubling/dbvirt-cli:latest [command] [subcommand] [params] [options]
```

- `[/your/project/path]`: Any system's directory that contains one or several Kubling project (like modules), needed by the command.
- `[path/in/container]`: The mount point inside the container.
- `command`: The `kdv` command to be executed, along with its subcommand, parameters and options.

Sample usage:
```sh copy
docker run --rm -v /root/dbvirt-samples/:/dbvirt-samples/ kubling/dbvirt-cli:latest bundle genmod /dbvirt-samples/azure/modules/delegate -o /dbvirt-samples/azure/modules/delegate/azure-module-bundle.zip
```
