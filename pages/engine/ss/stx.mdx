# SOFT_TRANSACTIONS Schema <Tag description={"v24.6+"} />

The `SOFT_TRANSACTIONS` schema provides visibility into the internal Soft Transaction subsystem.  
It is mainly used for inspection, debugging, and monitoring purposes.

## Tables and Views

### `SOFT_TRANSACTIONS.TXDB`

This table exposes a row for each Soft Transaction **operation** currently registered in the system.  
It reflects both in-progress and already-applied operations.
