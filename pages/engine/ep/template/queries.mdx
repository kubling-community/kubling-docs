# Queries
Allow to dynamically expose services that return a collection of rows using a SQL query.<br/>
Let's break down the definition of an endpoint using the following sample:

<Callout type="info">
  The examples below assume that the functions are part of a module named `mymod`.
</Callout>

```yaml showLineNumbers copy
{% set vdb = "k8s" %}
{% set tables = mymod__getTablesByTags(vdb=_context.vdb, schema="all", tags="kubernetes;deployment") %}
---

type: sqlDirect
virtualDatabase: {{ vdb }}

neededFields:
  - namespace

query: |
  {% set first = true %}
  {% for table in tables %}
    {{ "UNION ALL" | filterValWhenVarFalse(var="first", flip=true) }}
    SELECT * FROM {{ table }} WHERE metadata__namespace = '{{ namespace }}'
  {% endfor %}
    ORDER BY clusterName
```

This endpoint returns Kubernetes Deployments of **all** clusters defined as Data Source, running in a specified namespace.

The first line just sets a value to the `vdb` variable. Although it is not really useful here since the value does not change, it allows add custom logic when
having multiple Virtual Databases.

Second line is really interesting, since we get the list of `TABLE` names, of all `SCHEMAS` whose tags **contain** `kubernetes` and `deployment`.

`sqlDirect` type (the only one supported by now), tells the engine that the `query` field contains a valid Kubling SQL query.

In the line `8`, we define the input parameter fields needed by this endpoint, only one in this case. When defined, the engine expects the request sent by the client containing
a body document, in `JSON` or `YAML` format, with values for these fields.<br/>
When the template is parsed, these fields are injected in the template context.

What we want to have as a resulting query, is just a `UNION` query that aggregates results from multiple `TABLES`. To do so, we use a 
[loop](/template/parser#for-loop) to iterate over tables.

The `UNION ALL` keyword is placed between two `SELECT` expressions, therefore it must be omitted when printing the first `SELECT`. To achieve that, we use a 
very simple filter function called `filterValWhenVarFalse`, that returns `null` when the context variable passed as `var` param  is `false` and the actual filtered
value when it is `true`. When `flip` param is `true`, the `boolean` value is flipped each time the filter is called.<br/>
More information about filters [here](/template/parser#filters).

### Calling a Query Endpoint
The URL for calling a query endpoint is `http[s]://[address]:8282/api/v1/query/perform/[query_name]` where `query_name` is the name of the `YAML` file (without the extension).

Example: `POST` `http://localhost:8282/api/v1/query/perform/get_all_deployments` with body as follows:
```json copy
{ "namespace": "08abb0fc-f7af-4fe8-98d4-e76729567dc8" }
```
