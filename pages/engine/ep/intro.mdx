# Endpoints

Although SQL is a well-established and simple language that can be learned in just a few days, Kubling was originally designed to integrate with other systems, 
rather than being directly accessed by end users.

However, modern applications rarely interact with databases using plain SQL queries. To address this, we incorporated a mechanism similar to the way virtual databases 
are defined, allowing Kubling to expose HTTP endpoints for interacting with VDBs, schemas, and entities, offering a more flexible and accessible way to work with data.

Endpoints are divided into two different categories: templates and scripts.

## Templates

Templates are then subdivided into two types: Queries and Actions

Template endpoints logic are defined using `YAML` files, parsed as [templates](/template), and registered to the engine endpoints list during initialization.
`YAML` files must be located in the [Descriptor Bundle](/Concepts/artifacts#descriptor-bundle).

## Scripts <Tag description={"v25.5+"} />

When template expresiveness is not enough, you can also define custom endpoint using the Kubling's scripting JavaScript context.
As any other extension point using script contexts, it comes at a cost, since each request is executed in a thread and consumes resources, meaning that you will have
less resources for Kubling's core (SQL Jobs).
