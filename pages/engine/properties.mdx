# Properties

Property injection is the standard mechanism for passing variables into a Kubling instance. 
As a general rule, when a property is defined in a more specific context, it overrides any values set in a broader context.<br/>

## Environment variables
They are the most basic mechanism for passing variables. All variables are picked up when the engine initializes and are available in all template contexts.

## Properties File
A properties file, similar to `.env` files, specified at the [Main application configuration](/schemas#main-application-configuration) 
level using the `propertiesFilePath`. This file overrides any environment variable properties.

However, it’s important to note that variables defined in this file are not available during the parsing of the main application configuration itself.

The expected file format is as follows:
- Each entry is generally expected to be a single line of the form `key=value`. 
White space between the key and value is ignored, therefore `key = value` is equivalent.
- Lines starting with `#` are comments, therefore ignored.

## Data Source Properties
Properties passed in the [Virtual Database information file](/schemas#virtual-database-information-file-located-inside-the-descriptor-bundle), 
`dataSources.[data_source].properties` attribute.

Variables defined in this scope are available in Data Source configuration (`dataSources.[data_source].config`),
Translator configuration (`dataSources.[data_source].translatorConfig`), DDL (`dataSources.[data_source].schema.ddl`) 
and DDL Files (`dataSources.[data_source].schema.ddlFilePaths`).

It's important to note that Schema DDLs receive a special object in the context, called `schema`, which includes `dataSources.[data_source].schema`. 
If this object contains properties, they can be accessed via `schema.properties`. 
This approach enables reusability of common configuration files, such as `translatorConfig`, by isolating specific schema properties.


Properties specified in the Virtual Database (VDB) information file, defined using the `dataSources.[data_source].properties` attribute.

Variables defined at this level are accessible throughout the following configurations:

- Data Source Configuration (`dataSources.[data_source].config`)
- Translator Configuration (`dataSources.[data_source].translatorConfig`)
- Schema DDL (`dataSources.[data_source].schema.ddl`)
- DDL Files (`dataSources.[data_source].schema.ddlFilePaths`).

It's important to highlight that Schema DDLs are injected with a special context object named `schema`, which includes `dataSources.[data_source].schema`. 
If the `schema` object contains `properties`, they can be accessed via `schema.properties`. This enables flexibility and reusability, 
especially when working with shared configurations, such as `translatorConfig`. For an example, refer to the [Built-in Kubernetes DDL](/engine/ds/k8s#ddl) section, 
which demonstrates a practical use case.
