# Aggregators

The **aggregator** is a special `schema` type that enables automatic view creation based on other data sources. 
This feature simplifies querying across multiple sources by aggregating data into views, which are easier to manage.

Consider a scenario where we have several Kubernetes clusters, each defined as a data source within our VDB (Virtual Database). 
If we want to know, for example, which cluster a specific deployment is running on, one approach is to write a query that joins tables from all relevant schemas. 
However, this process becomes increasingly complex when managing dozens of clusters.

Relational databases address such scenarios with `VIEWs`, and Kubling follows the same pattern. A `VIEW` is a virtual table constructed from the result of a query, 
which can be defined in DDL. But in our Kubernetes example, where each cluster has its own schema, it’s unclear where to define a `VIEW` that spans all clusters.

This is where **aggregators** come in. They automatically generate views from tables across multiple `schemas`, streamlining multi-cluster data queries.

Example:
```yaml
aggregatorSchemaModels:
  - name: "k8s"
    schemas:
      - "k8s_1"
      - "k8s_2"
    tables:
      - name: "DEPLOYMENT"
        options:
          updatable: false
      - name: "NAMESPACE"
        options:
          updatable: false
      - name: "DEPLOYMENT_CONDITIONS"
        options:
          updatable: false
      - name: "DEPLOYMENT_CONTAINER"
        options:
          updatable: false
      - name: "DEPLOYMENT_CONTAINER_VOLS"
        options:
          updatable: false
```

This configuration creates a new `SCHEMA` called `k8s` in the `VDB`. 
The tables in this schema, such as `DEPLOYMENT` and `NAMESPACE`, are actually `VIEWs` that aggregate data from the `k8s_1` and `k8s_2` schemas using a `UNION ALL`.

## Primary Keys
When using aggregators, be cautious when selecting the primary key for your `SCHEMA` definitions, as key duplication may occur.

If a data source does not provide a globally unique key, you should use the Kubling `val_pk` directive while considering the aggregation implications.

For instance, in Kubernetes, if you have only one cluster, it may not be necessary to create primary keys that concatenate the cluster name. 
However, if you plan to add more clusters in the future, you should construct the primary key to include a cluster identifier, as shown below:
```sql
...
identifier string OPTIONS(val_pk 'clusterName+metadata__namespace+metadata__name+name'),
PRIMARY KEY(identifier),
...
```

## Errors or empty results
Since `VIEWS` in the aggregator context rely on `UNION ALL` (which includes duplicates) to merge results, 
the query planner (DQP) evaluates costs differently compared to standard queries. 
In the case of Kubernetes data sources, this behavior might be influenced by the `blankNamespaceStrategy` configuration.
