## Portable Local Data Source (`PORTABLE_LOCAL`) <Tag description={"v24.5.7+"} />

This **database data source** is based on the **H2 database engine**. It creates a **single-file, locally-stored database**.

The primary goal of this data source is to create lightweight, portable databases for storing **small amounts of information** that:

- Must persist across Kubling engine shutdowns.
- Can be shared with other Kubling instances or tools.

H2 was chosen over Kubling's internal small database engine (used for metadata storage) because it provides greater flexibility:

- You can open H2 databases using a wide variety of third-party tools.
- Accessing data does not depend on Kubling, making it easier to extract or view stored information independently.
- It allows you to treat this data source as any other regular remote data source.

### Limitations
As this data source is based on H2, some limitations apply. For more information, check [H2's official documentation](https://www.h2database.com/html/advanced.html#limits_limitations).

<Callout type='warning'>
  Based on our internal testing, and to maintain optimal performance, we recommend keeping this data source under **1 GB** in size when operating under memory constraints. Complex queries may require memory that is also used by the engine itself.

  If you plan to work with larger database files, we strongly suggest enabling local disk buffering (via the `buffer.useDisk` option in the application configuration). This allows Kubling to minimize memory usage and ensures more resources are available for the embedded H2 engine.
</Callout>

## Schema migrations <Tag description={"v25.5+"} />

Local H2 database schemas can be migrated using an embedded mechanism based on the battle-tested [Flyway](https://github.com/flyway/flyway).

When `migrationDir` is specified, the engine performs a Flyway-based migration using the SQL files located in the given directory. For example:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.File name="bundle-info.yaml" />
  <FileTree.Folder name="vdb">
    <FileTree.File name="MigrationsVDB.yaml" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="migration">
      <FileTree.File name="V1__create_tables.sql" />
      <FileTree.File name="V2__insert_seed_data.sql" />
      <FileTree.File name="V3__add_new_column.sql" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

You can then reference the directory like this: `migrationDir: "bundle:migration"`.

### Audit Table

Flyway requires a table to track migration state. For this purpose, Kubling automatically creates a table named `KUBLING_MIGRATION_AUDIT`, which **must not be modified externally**.

<Callout type='info'>
  Note that `ddlFilePaths` is ignored when `migrationDir` is used — the two mechanisms are mutually exclusive.

  For stateful, non-ephemeral Kubling instances that rely on a local database, we strongly recommend using migrations instead of embedding schema creation logic in a single H2 DDL file.
</Callout>

## Recommendations

Here are some best practices and useful notes when using Flyway-based migrations in Kubling:

### Use Versioned Files with Clear Naming
Follow Flyway’s naming convention:
`V<version_number>__<description>.sql`

Examples:
- `V1__create_tables.sql`
- `V2__add_indexes.sql`
- `V3__insert_initial_data.sql`

This helps track schema evolution clearly and consistently.

### One Logical Change per Migration
Keep each migration file focused on a single change (e.g., creating a table, adding a column).  
This improves readability and makes it easier to troubleshoot if a migration fails.

### What Happens If a Migration Fails?
- **Kubling will abort the engine initialization process and exit with an error message.**
- Flyway stops the process immediately at the failing script.
- Successful migrations remain applied.
- The failing migration is not marked as executed and will be retried on the next engine startup.
- **There is no automatic rollback**. If rollback is required, it must be defined inside the SQL script using transactional logic.

### No Manual Schema Changes
Avoid modifying the database schema outside of migrations.  
Manual changes may cause checksum errors or future migrations to fail.

### Do Not Modify the Audit Table
The table `KUBLING_MIGRATION_AUDIT` is managed internally and must not be edited or cleared manually.

### Retrying a Failed Migration
To retry:
1. Fix the faulty migration file.
2. Restart the engine.
3. Flyway will reapply the failed script and continue with the sequence.

Do **not** rename or remove the failing file, as this will break integrity checks.

### Test Before Production
If running a stateful or non-ephemeral Kubling instance, always test migrations in a staging environment to avoid irreversible schema changes.

### Version Control Your Migrations
Migration files are part of your application’s state. Always include them in version control to keep environments consistent.
