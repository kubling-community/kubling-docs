## InMemory Data Source (`EMBEDDED_INMEM`)
This Data Source creates an in-memory embedded database that operates entirely within system memory.<br/>
Initially added to Kubling as an internal feature for conducting heavy testing without needing an external database instance, 
it has since proven useful based on user feedback. 
It can also be employed for various operational tasks such as storing instance-related information, caching data, managing temporary tables, or synchronizing scripts.

## Configuration
Uses the Standard DB Data Source Configuration.

Kubling uses an adapted version of the popular H2 DB Engine, so please refer to [their documentation](https://github.com/h2database/h2database) to get info about the supported grammar
and other limitations.

<Callout>
  In this Data Source DDLs have a special meaning, since they're used to create the in-memory table schema, therefore they are not [standard Kubling DDL](/Engine/DDL).<br/>
  After creation and setup, the Engine imports schemas automatically, so there is not option of controlling the `FOREIGN` tables manually like in other Data Sources.
