# SNMP Data Source (`SNMP`) <Tag description={"v25.4+"} /> <Tag bgColor={"bg-kubling-dark-violet"} txtColor={"text-white"} description={"PREVIEW"} txtFont={"font-gilroyBold"} />

<Callout type="warning">
As of version `25.4`, **SNMP** adapter is **read-only**. Only `SELECT` queries are supported.  
`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations are **not yet available**.

We’re actively working to support write capabilities in upcoming releases.

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely adopted protocol used to monitor and manage devices on IP networks—such as switches, routers, servers, 
and embedded systems. It allows querying of structured device data via lightweight, request-response messages over UDP and TCP.

At the core of SNMP is the **OID** (Object Identifier): a dot-separated numeric path that uniquely identifies a data point exposed by a device. 
For example, the OID `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5` typically corresponds to the system's hostname (`sysName`). These identifiers are part of a global, hierarchical tree managed by IANA and device vendors.

Devices expose OIDs through a **Management Information Base (MIB)**, a virtual schema that defines the structure, data types, and semantics of available metrics. 
Most MIBs are vendor-specific extensions of standardized SNMP trees.

SNMP organizes data into **tables** and **scalar values**, and many real-world use cases rely on iterating full tables (e.g. network interfaces, physical components, power states). 
Kubling abstracts this complexity by allowing you to model SNMP data directly using `CREATE FOREIGN TABLE` statements.

<Callout type='warning'>
As of version `25.4`, only **UDP** connections are supported for SNMP.  
We are working to add **TCP** support, so expect it in a future release.

It defines objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent to test an interface for various faults.  Tests for an interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that interface.  After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult can be read to determine the outcome.  If an agent can not perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate.  The object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test- specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific) information concerning the outcome of the test.  Only one test can be in progress on each interface at any one time. If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the second test is rejected.  Some agents may reject a test when a prior test is active on another interface. Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain ''ownership'' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the interface to be tested.  This is accomplished with the ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows: try_again: get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) while (ifTestStatus != notInUse) /* * Loop while a test is running or some other * manager is configuring a test. */ short delay get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) } /* * Is not being used right now -- let''s compete * to see who gets it. */ lock_value = ifTestId if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse, ifTestOwner = ''my-IP-address'') == FAILURE) /* * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go * try again */ goto try_again; /* * I have the lock */ set up any test parameters. /* * This starts the test */ set(ifTestType = test_to_run); wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult agent also sets ifTestStatus = ''notInUse'' retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid A manager station first retrieves the value of the appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of ifTestStatus is ''notInUse''.  The manager station then tries to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to ''inUse'', and the corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating itself.  If the set operation succeeds then the manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the semantics of TestAndIncr).  Failure of the set operation indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry. Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType. On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to ''notInUse''.  Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the results.  In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be a possibility that the first test''s results might be overwritten by the second test''s results prior to the first results being read.  This unlikely circumstance can be detected by a network manager retrieving ifTestId at the same time as retrieving the test results, and ensuring that the results are for the desired request. If ifTestType is not set within an abnormally long period of time after ownership is obtained, the agent should time-out the manager, and reset the value of the ifTestStatus object back to ''notInUse''.  It is suggested that this time-out period be 5 minutes. In general, a management station must not retransmit a request to invoke a test for which it does not receive a response; instead, it properly inspects an agent''s MIB to determine if the invocation was successful.  Only if the invocation was unsuccessful, is the invocation request retransmitted. Some tests may require the interface to be taken off-line in order to execute them, or may even require the agent to reboot after completion of the test.  In these circumstances, communication with the management station invoking the test may be lost until after completion of the test.  An agent is not required to support such tests. However, if such tests are supported, then the agent should make every effort to transmit a response to the request which invoked the test prior to losing communication.  When the agent is restored to normal service, the results of the test are properly made available in the appropriate objects. Note that this requires that the ifIndex value assigned to an interface must be unchanged even if the test causes a reboot.  An agent must reject any test for which it cannot, perhaps due to resource constraints, make available at least the minimum amount of information after that test completes.');

### Configuration Goal

This example connects to an SNMPv3-compatible device at `100.100.1.2` on port `161`.

#### Basic Connection

- **`version: "V3"`**  
  Uses SNMP version 3, which includes authentication and encryption.

- **`address` / `port`**  
  IP address and SNMP port of the target device. `161` is the standard SNMP port.

#### SNMPv3 Authentication

The `v3Config` block defines SNMPv3 security parameters:

- **`username`** – The SNMPv3 identity configured on the device.
- **`authProtocol`** / **`privacyProtocol`** – Cryptographic algorithms for authentication and encryption.
- **`authenticationPassphrase`** / **`privacyPassphrase`** – Corresponding secrets used to verify and decrypt traffic.

#### Local Port Binding

- **`localBindingPorts`**  
  When using UDP (the default transport for SNMP), Kubling must bind to a local port in order to receive responses from the target device. This setting defines the set of ports available for that binding.

  Kubling checks whether the number of available ports is sufficient to support the configured connection pool. If the number of usable local ports is too low to satisfy the pool’s concurrency settings (`partitions × maxConnections`), the engine will fail to initialize the SNMP source.

  You can specify a single port, a list, or a range using syntax like:  
  `"1162"`, `"1162,1163"`, or `"1162-1164"`.

#### Connection Pooling

- **`connectionPool`**  
  Controls concurrency for SNMP sessions:
  - `partitions: 1` – Number of internal connection pools (typically leave as 1).
  - `minConnections` / `maxConnections` – Limits for open connections per partition.

## Table Types

### `full_table`

In `full_table` mode, the adapter performs a single bulk query to the SNMP agent, requesting all the OIDs defined in the table schema. This is the most efficient and schema-aligned way to retrieve structured data and is typically the preferred mode for most devices.

Because SNMP agents may respond with slightly different OID formats (e.g. longer-than-expected suffixes or intermediate indexing layers), Kubling uses a **backtracking approach** to match returned OIDs to their corresponding schema columns. This means it progressively removes segments from the end of each response OID until it finds a match in the defined table.

#### Example

Suppose the schema includes this column:

```sql
ifOperStatus string OPTIONS (snmp_oid '1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8')
```

And the device replies with an OID like:

```
1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8.5.99
```

The adapter will attempt the following matches, in order:

- `1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8.5.99` → no match  
- `1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8.5` → no match  
- `1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8` → ✅ match found

Once a match is identified, the trailing parts (e.g. `.5.99`) can be used to populate the index columns, using `snmp_derived_index`.

<Callout>
This fallback logic ensures compatibility with a wide range of SNMP agents, including those with non-standard or compound indexing structures.
</Callout>

### `static_mapping`

`static_mapping` mode is designed for **non-tabular SNMP data**, such as system metadata, configuration values, or individual counters.

In this mode, Kubling sends a **single SNMP request (PDU)** containing all the OIDs defined in the table. 
When the response is received, the adapter attempts to match each **full OID exactly** to a column declared in the schema. 
There is no backtracking or index extraction—only a strict 1:1 OID-to-column match.

This mode is ideal for tables where each field corresponds to a fixed OID with no indexing.

#### Example

```sql
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE "system" (
  sysName       string OPTIONS (snmp_oid '1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0'),
  sysDescr      string OPTIONS (snmp_oid '1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0'),
  sysUpTime     string OPTIONS (snmp_oid '1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0')
)
OPTIONS (snmp_type 'static_mapping');
```

Each OID here represents a specific scalar value, such as the device hostname, description, or uptime, and will be matched strictly as written.

<Callout type='info'>
Use `static_mapping` only when working with flat, index-free structures. For SNMP tables or any indexed data, prefer `full_table`.
</Callout>

### `dynamic_table`

The `dynamic_table` mode is designed for **exploration and introspection** rather than structured querying. 
It allows Kubling (or agentic workflows) to walk unknown OID trees starting from a given prefix and retrieve raw values.

This is particularly useful when building autonomous agents that need to explore devices, infer available metrics, and iteratively define or refine schemas.

Unlike `full_table` or `static_mapping`, this mode doesn’t require predefined OIDs. Instead, you must provide a `snmp_oid_prefix`, and Kubling will walk all OIDs under that subtree.

#### Required Columns

`dynamic_table` expects a flexible schema with **special column names** that map to key SNMP walk results:

- **`position`** – the last segment of the OID (e.g. `.5` in `...1.3.6.1.5`).
- **`value`** – the actual SNMP value returned from the device.
- **`oid`** – if included, Kubling will populate it with the full OID path for each result.

#### Example

```sql
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE walkCpu (
  position string,
  value string,
  oid string
)
OPTIONS (
  snmp_type 'dynamic_table',
  snmp_oid_prefix '1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.11'
);
```

This would walk the subtree for CPU-related stats on many Unix-style agents and return the raw OID/value pairs.

## Data Types

SNMP does not expose strongly typed values in the same way Kubling does. All SNMP data is retrieved as raw, loosely typed values, 
typically as strings, integers, or opaque binary blocks.

One of Kubling’s key features is **data type transformation**: when a value is retrieved from an SNMP agent, the adapter 
obtains its string representation and attempts to convert it into the appropriate column type as defined in your table schema.

This allows you to work with proper data types, such as `integer`, `boolean`, `long`, or `timestamp`, even though SNMP itself doesn’t support them natively.

<Callout>
For a full list of supported data type conversions, refer to the [DataTypeManager source code](https://github.com/kubling-community/kubling-teiid-os/blob/master/common-core/src/main/java/com/kubling/teiid/core/types/DataTypeManager.java).
</Callout>

## Using MIB Databases

Kubling supports defining SNMP tables using **MIB-based OID name resolution**, making your schemas more readable and easier to maintain.

To enable this feature, first generate a JSON-formatted MIB database using [`gosmi-json-exporter`](/engine/ds/industrial/tools/gosmi-json-exporter):

```bash
gosmi-json-exporter \
  --mibdir ./mibs \
  --module IF-MIB \
  --out ./if-mib.json
```

Then reference the file in your SNMP source configuration:

```yaml
configObject:
  ...
  mibJsonFilePath: /etc/kubling/mibs/mymib.json
```

### Declaring Columns with `snmp_oid_from_db`

Once the MIB database is configured, you can define table columns using the `snmp_oid_from_db` directive instead of hardcoding OIDs.

#### 1. **Implicit OID Name Resolution**

If you omit the value, Kubling will use the **column name** to resolve the OID from the MIB:

```sql
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE ifTestTable (
  ifTestId     string OPTIONS (snmp_oid_from_db ''),
  ifTestStatus string OPTIONS (snmp_oid_from_db ''),
  ifTestType   string OPTIONS (snmp_oid_from_db ''),
  ifTestResult string OPTIONS (snmp_oid_from_db '')
)
```

Each column name (e.g. `ifTestStatus`) is matched against the MIB entries in the configured `mymib.json`.

#### 2. **Explicit OID Name Resolution**

You can also provide an explicit MIB object name when the column name differs:

```sql
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE myTable (
  ifName        string OPTIONS (snmp_oid_from_db ''),
  operationalId string OPTIONS (snmp_oid_from_db 'deviceOpId')
)
```

In this case, `deviceOpId` is looked up in the MIB database and resolved to the appropriate OID.

<Callout type="warning">
Kubling currently supports only **flat JSON** structures when using a MIB database.  
Avoid specifying `--grouping` or `--depth` options in `gosmi-json-exporter` if you intend to use the resulting JSON with Kubling.
</Callout>

### Autogenerating DDL from MIBs

The [`gosmi-json-exporter`](/engine/ds/industrial/tools/gosmi-json-exporter) CLI also supports emitting a full Kubling `DDL` file based on MIB definitions, 
allowing you to quickly bootstrap table definitions from real MIBs.

To generate a Kubling-compatible DDL file:

```bash
gosmi-json-exporter \
  --mibdir ./mibs \
  --module IF-MIB \
  --dump-tables \
  --sql-schema \
  --out ./if-mib.ddl
```

This will emit one or more table definition statements using `snmp_oid` directives, along with annotations derived from the MIB's description fields.

You can then reference this file in your SNMP data source configuration:

```yaml
configObject:
  ...
schema:
  ddlFilePaths:
    - "bundle:my-schema.ddl"
```

## Advanced SNMP Queries in Action

Once SNMP data is modeled in Kubling, it becomes fully queryable using SQL, just like any structured data source.  
This section highlights real-world queries that go beyond basic polling or monitoring, showcasing the analytical and relational power of Kubling's approach.

---

### 1. Interface Traffic Summary (In/Out/Total)

```sql
SELECT
    ifName,
    ROUND(ifHCInOctets / 1073741824.0, 2) AS gb_in,
    ROUND(ifHCOutOctets / 1073741824.0, 2) AS gb_out,
    ROUND((IFNULL(ifHCInOctets,0) + IFNULL(ifHCOutOctets,0)) / 1073741824.0, 2) AS total_gb
FROM snmpfull.ifXTable
WHERE ifName LIKE 'gi%'
ORDER BY total_gb DESC
```

This query computes traffic in gigabytes across all interfaces whose name starts with `gi` (e.g., Gigabit Ethernet).  
It demonstrates simple math, filtering, and sorting directly on SNMP counters.

---

### 2. Interfaces with Errors or Discards

```sql
SELECT
    x.ifName,
    b.ifInDiscards,
    b.ifOutDiscards,
    b.ifInErrors,
    b.ifOutErrors,
    (b.ifInDiscards + b.ifOutDiscards + b.ifInErrors + b.ifOutErrors) AS total_issues
FROM snmpfull.ifXTable AS x
JOIN snmpfull.ifTable AS b ON x.ifIndex = b.ifIndex
WHERE (b.ifInDiscards + b.ifOutDiscards + b.ifInErrors + b.ifOutErrors) > 0
ORDER BY total_issues DESC
```

Combines interface names with reliability metrics.  
This is useful for identifying problem ports or links with chronic errors or discards.

<Callout type="info">
Most SNMP interface metrics are split across different tables like `ifTable` and `ifXTable`.  
To correlate human-readable names with performance counters, join them using the shared `ifIndex`.
</Callout>

---

### 3. Traffic Breakdown by Interface Type

```sql
SELECT
    SUBSTRING(ifName, 1, 2) AS interface_type,
    ROUND(SUM(IFNULL(ifHCInOctets, 0) + IFNULL(ifHCOutOctets, 0)) / 1073741824.0, 2) AS total_gb
FROM snmpfull.ifXTable
GROUP BY interface_type
ORDER BY total_gb DESC
```

This query aggregates traffic by interface prefix (`gi`, `te`, `po`, etc.), showing usage trends by interface class.  
It’s useful in infrastructure capacity planning and visual reporting.

---

### 4. Device Uptime in Hours

```sql
SELECT
    sysName,
    sysUpTime,
    ROUND(sysUpTime / 6000.0 / 60.0 / 60.0, 1) AS uptime_hours
FROM snmpfull."system"
ORDER BY uptime_hours DESC
```

The `sysUpTime` field reports time in hundredths of a second. This query translates it into hours and ranks devices by uptime.

---

### 5. Map Hardware Components to Their Chassis

```sql
SELECT
    parent.name AS chassis,
    child.name AS component,
    child.class AS type
FROM snmpfull.entityPhysical AS child
LEFT JOIN snmpfull.entityPhysical AS parent
  ON child.parentIndex = parent.index
WHERE child.class != 'chassis'
ORDER BY chassis, component
```

This shows how SNMP data can be treated as hierarchical — useful for mapping physical components (modules, cards) back to their chassis.  
It also demonstrates **self-joins**, which are uncommon in SNMP tools but fully supported in Kubling.

---

These examples illustrate how Kubling turns structured SNMP tables into powerful, queryable operational datasets.

<Callout>
SNMP data doesn't have to live in isolation. In Kubling, you can **combine it with inventory systems, databases, sensors, or ERP data**, 
creating unified operational models like a full data center Bill of Materials (BOM), equipment lifecycle tracking, or cross-protocol health views.

This unlocks use cases well beyond monitoring — including analytics, automation, and agent-driven optimization.
