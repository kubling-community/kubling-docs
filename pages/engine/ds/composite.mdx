# Composite Data Source (`COMPOSITE`) <Tag description={"v25.1+"} />

The **Composite Data Source** is a **proxy data source** that allows you to create a schema by **composing multiple other schemas**.  
Unlike traditional database sources, it **does not maintain direct connections** with remote data sources. Instead, it **intercepts incoming commands**, modifies them as needed, and **routes them to the appropriate data source**.

## When to Use Composite

#### **Unifying Multiple Sources into One Schema**
The primary use case is when you want to **avoid configuring clients (such as applications or AI agents) to interact with multiple schemas**. Instead, you can define a **composite schema**, which acts as a **single logical unit**, but internally **routes queries to the appropriate underlying schemas on a per-table basis**.

#### **Maintaining a Consistent Data Model**
In complex scenarios—such as designing a **data model for an IT landscape**—you may need to integrate **dozens of remote data sources**.  
Instead of dealing with multiple scattered schemas, **Composite Data Source** allows you to consolidate everything into **one unified schema**, making the entire **data model easier to understand and manage**.

## Configuration

```yaml

    id: "schema:kubling:dbvirt:model:vdb:sources:ConnectionPool"
    properties:
      partitions:

          \ queue for a connection from the pool. Once reached, an error is thrown\

  imports:
    type: "array"
    items:
      type: "object"
      id: "schema:kubling:dbvirt:translation:model:routing:ImportElement"
      properties:
        dataSource:

</details>

The **Composite Data Source** can be configured in two ways:
1. **Direct Import** – Similar to `passthrough` mode, where schemas are cloned from other data sources.
2. **Custom Schema (DDL)** – Allows renaming tables, adding fields, or applying transformations.

### **Direct Import**
The composite schema is automatically **generated by cloning** schemas from other data sources.

```yaml
- name: "composite_import"
  dataSourceType: "COMPOSITE"
  configObject:
    dataSourceName: "composite"
    imports:
      - dataSource: "redis"
        tableNamePattern: ".+"
      - dataSource: "psql"
        tableNamePattern: "\\bITOPS_\\w+\\b"
  ...      
```

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important Considerations:**
  - **Table name conflicts**: Composite **does not allow** importing tables with the **same name** (as schemas must have unique table names).
  - **Choosing the right approach**: If the data sources you are trying to compose **share the same schema structure**, you likely need [`ROUTING`](/Engine/ds/routing) instead of `COMPOSITE`.
</Callout>

### **Custom Schema (DDL)**

If you need to **rename tables**, **add fields**, or **apply transformations**, you can define a **custom schema** using DDL.  
In this case, each `TABLE` must specify its **parent table** using the fully qualified object name via the `composite_parent` directive.

```yaml
- name: "composite_import"
  dataSourceType: "COMPOSITE"
  configObject:    
    ...
  schema:
    type: "PHYSICAL"
    cacheDefaultStrategy: "NO_CACHE"
    ddl: |
      CREATE FOREIGN TABLE INTERNAL_APPS (
          name string,
          version string,
          team string,
          ...
      )
      OPTIONS(updatable true,
              composite_parent 'psql.ITOPS_APPS');
```

## Specific `TABLE` Directives

| Directive           | Type   | Options | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|--------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `composite_parent` | String | Any     | Specifies the fully qualified parent `TABLE` in another schema that this `TABLE` maps to. The format must be `[schema_name].[table_name]`. This directive is required when defining a composite schema using custom DDL. |
