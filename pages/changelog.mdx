# Product changelog

## v25.1.2
- Fixed an issue in the Cassandra Data Source that prevented `SELECT` queries from completing correctly when processing millions of tuples.
- Fixed the `cosineDistance` function, which failed when applied to high-dimensional vectors (1000+).

## v25.1.1
- Fixed an issue where expiration was being ignored in the Redis data source during `UPDATE` operations on the hash data structure.

## v25.1  
- Introduced Redis as a new Data Source type.  
- Introduced Cassandra as a new Data Source type.  
- Introduced Composite as a new Data Source type.  
- Introduced Routing as a new Data Source type.  
- Enabled the definition of additional columns in Database Data Sources.  
- Added query functions for basic vector operations.  
- Documented the `TIMESTAMPADD` and `TIMESTAMPDIFF` query functions.  
- Introduced an HTTP endpoint to display query plans, similar to the `EXPLAIN` command in other database engines.  

## v24.5.7
- Added support for SQL query functions, defined in modules. Configuration mechanism has changed, [please check it here](/Modules/Functions/SQL)
- Added Portable Local data source.
- Enhanced clarity and detail in error messages for critical failures.

## v24.5.6
- **It is now possible to use a parent field in a `synthetic` table with the format `synthetic_type 'parent', synthetic_parent_field 'another_field'` in filters.**
- Descriptor Module Bundle now supports scheduled scripts, similar to other modules.
- Resolved Out-Of-Memory (OOM) problems encountered when running certain queries on the `KUBERNETES` data source.
- Introduced a new environment variable flag, `KBL_SKIP_ENV_VAR_TEMP_FILE_ENCRYPTION`, 
to prevent the local environment variable buffer file (used for restarting the instance) from being encrypted. 
This resolves issues where containers could not be stopped and restarted due to an invalid random key.
- Enhanced the built-in DDL for the Kubernetes data source to cover reported use cases.

## v24.5.5
- Introduced a new system schema called `SYSMETRICS`, which includes a table named `METRICS` for retrieving the engine's metrics values.
- Removed the metric `kubling.engine.sql.plan.enqueued_time.max` and replaced it with `kubling.engine.sql.plan.enqueued.max`.

## v24.5.4
- Implemented the distinction between `passthrough` and regular access in Database data sources. Therefore, you can now extend schemas also in these type of data sources. [Learn more](/Engine/ds/db-data-sources).
- Added support for parameter lists in SQL functions.
- Updated function module loading (SQL and Template) to support multiple modules instead of a single one. Changes to naming resolution were introduced; read more [here](/Modules/Functions/SQL) and [here](/Modules/Functions/Template).
- It is no longer necessary to pass random values for generated fields in `INSERT` and `UPDATE` operations. The Query Engine now identifies and handles these fields automatically before executing the final command.
- Fixed an issue that prevented the use of non-generated fields as filters with subqueries.
- Updated embedded web console to reflect the above-mentioned changes.
- Official images were renamed to `kubling/kubling-ce` and `kubling/kubling-cli`.

## v24.5.3
- Implemented Cache. [See here.](/Engine/cache)
- Added metrics to monitor Cache. [See here.](/Observability/metrics#cache-related-metrics-)
- Implemented first-class Document functions. [See here.](/Engine/queries#document-functions-)
- Engine Stream Buffer can now use local disk. See the `buffer` configuration option in the [main application configuration](/schemas#main-application-configuration).
- Updated embedded web console to reflect the above-mentioned changes.

## v24.5.2
- Added `blankNamespaceStrategy` option to the Kubernetes Data Source Configuration.
- Added a new aggregator schema button in the console, under Virtual Databases.
- Fixed the JavaScript filesystem cache, which in some circumstances resulted in a false cache miss when the resource had been visited before, especially during `import`.
- Added `metadata__uid` in all deployment related `TABLE`, in the built-in Kubernetes DDL
