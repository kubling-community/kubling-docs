# Product changelog

## v25.5
- Added JavaScript HTTP endpoints, allowing you to define custom paths and handle them directly within your scripts.
- Added a new way of defining instrumentation at the application level, with support for OpenTelemetry and DataDog formats, including endpoints for pushing metrics.
- Added the `SYSREGISTRY` system table, exposing internal information used for traceability across immutable instances.
- Added support for HTTP TLS certificates, affecting all HTTP-based endpoints.
- Changed the container’s base image to [distroless CC](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless/tree/main/cc), due to an error reported in some environments with memory constraints where the garbage collector attempted to call non-existent system functions.
- Portable Local data source now supports flyway migrations.
- Fixed an issue with the MySQL data source that prevented Kubling from initializing correctly due to an incorrectly constructed connection string.

## v25.4.3
- **Kubling is now completely free, no more Community or Enterprise editions. A single, unified distribution going forward.**.
- Fixed batch/bulk `UPDATE` handling in the `routing` data source.

## v25.4.2
- Enabled top-level comparison support for the `json` data type, allowing standard operators (e.g. `=`) to be used directly in filters and joins involving JSON values.
- Added automatic detection of the `jsonb` data type in PostgreSQL with implicit transformation using the `::jsonb` suffix in pushed-down queries to avoid type-related errors.
- Updated Kubernetes API support for compatibility with the latest version.
- Removed a limitation that prevented the use of implicit joins (multiple tables in `FROM`) in PostgreSQL and MySQL due to specific query plans generated by the DQP.
- Fixed an issue where prepared statement parameters were incorrectly skipped when `LIMIT` was included as a parameterized value.

## v25.4.1
- Fixed Cassandra adapter to resolve an issue where, under certain conditions, the total number of visible rows was incorrectly limited to the page size. 
This was caused by a premature termination of the data stream.
- Addressed an issue where the console returned an HTTP 500 error when adding new data sources, due to changes in underlying configuration object handling.


## v25.4
- Added support for **SNMP**.
- Added support for **Modbus**.
- Introduced class whitelisting to prevent unsafe object deserialization and injection attacks.
- Added IP filtering per transport, supporting both CIDR whitelisting and blacklisting.
- Introduced two new traffic metrics (per transport) to track total bytes transferred.
- Added PostgreSQL system objects (tables and views) to support standard metadata queries. Now, universal DB tools like DBeaver should be able to retrieve database metadata when using the PG transport.

## v25.3.6
- Fixed an issue affecting `COMPOSITE` data source type that depleted connection pool when constructing querying database metadata concurrently from several connections and the same time.

## v25.3.5
- Updated to new Kubling core version. [See here.](https://github.com/kubling-community/kubling-teiid-os/commit/564a16895f2b8aff11fbc1f56be0fe1b78878077)

## v25.3.4
- Fixed an issue where a column defined as `call_func`, when invoking standard SQL functions (introduced in v25.3.2), 
was not correctly processed when the parameters provided were not part of the query's projected columns. 
The query engine now automatically expands the projection to include the required fields before passing the query to the translator, 
ensuring proper execution on the remote data source without affecting the original projection requested in the command.

## v25.3.3
- Fixed an issue affecting all Database datasources where the schema component of the fully qualified name (`NAMEINSOURCE`) was erroneously removed by 
the translator before being passed to the remote data source, potentially causing query errors in certain scenarios.

## v25.3.2
- Fixed an issue where essential classes for Spatial operations were incorrectly removed during native image generation. 
Although the necessary dependencies were present, the classes were marked as unreachable and excluded from the final binary.
- Added support for using SQL functions within the DDL `call_func` directive.

## v25.3.1
- Fixed an issue that created the soft transaction row locks DB even when the feature was disabled at the application level.
- Added support to mark data sources as contributors to the global health check.
- Introduced the new `SYSMETRICS.DataSources` table, which provides data source–level health status.

## v25.3
- Implemented the Soft Transaction Engine
- Added `SYSMETRICS.Health` table.

## v25.2
- Introduced agentic endpoints that enable capability propagation to any upstream agent following the expected message contract.
- Fixed an issue in the Cassandra data source where Kubling SQL expressions like `field = field + 1` were not correctly translated to Cassandra’s `+=` operator for `COUNTER` fields.
- Added support for defining properties directly in the application configuration, useful when an external properties file is not an option.
- Added caching support for the Redis data source, based on user feedback.
- Added support for Redis counter field types.
- Added the ability to transparently define table names as part of keys in Redis, to avoid mixing up entries when using `LIKE`.
- Added support for batch updates to the Redis data source (e.g., when performing a `SELECT ... INTO`).
- Added `importer.tableNamePattern` to the Cassandra data type.
- Added support for DataStax configuration file definition in the Cassandra data type.

## v25.1.2
- Fixed an issue in the Cassandra Data Source that prevented `SELECT` queries from completing correctly when processing millions of tuples.
- Fixed the `cosineDistance` function, which failed when applied to high-dimensional vectors (1000+).

## v25.1.1
- Fixed an issue where expiration was being ignored in the Redis data source during `UPDATE` operations on the hash data structure.

## v25.1  
- Introduced Redis as a new Data Source type.  
- Introduced Cassandra as a new Data Source type.  
- Introduced Composite as a new Data Source type.  
- Introduced Routing as a new Data Source type.  
- Enabled the definition of additional columns in Database Data Sources.  
- Added query functions for basic vector operations.  
- Documented the `TIMESTAMPADD` and `TIMESTAMPDIFF` query functions.  
- Introduced an HTTP endpoint to display query plans, similar to the `EXPLAIN` command in other database engines.  

## v24.5.7
- Added support for SQL query functions, defined in modules. Configuration mechanism has changed, [please check it here](/Modules/Functions/SQL)
- Added Portable Local data source.
- Enhanced clarity and detail in error messages for critical failures.

## v24.5.6
- **It is now possible to use a parent field in a `synthetic` table with the format `synthetic_type 'parent', synthetic_parent_field 'another_field'` in filters.**
- Descriptor Module Bundle now supports scheduled scripts, similar to other modules.
- Resolved Out-Of-Memory (OOM) problems encountered when running certain queries on the `KUBERNETES` data source.
- Introduced a new environment variable flag, `KBL_SKIP_ENV_VAR_TEMP_FILE_ENCRYPTION`, 
to prevent the local environment variable buffer file (used for restarting the instance) from being encrypted. 
This resolves issues where containers could not be stopped and restarted due to an invalid random key.
- Enhanced the built-in DDL for the Kubernetes data source to cover reported use cases.

## v24.5.5
- Introduced a new system schema called `SYSMETRICS`, which includes a table named `METRICS` for retrieving the engine's metrics values.
- Removed the metric `kubling.engine.sql.plan.enqueued_time.max` and replaced it with `kubling.engine.sql.plan.enqueued.max`.

## v24.5.4
- Implemented the distinction between `passthrough` and regular access in Database data sources. Therefore, you can now extend schemas also in these type of data sources. [Learn more](/Engine/ds/db-data-sources).
- Added support for parameter lists in SQL functions.
- Updated function module loading (SQL and Template) to support multiple modules instead of a single one. Changes to naming resolution were introduced; read more [here](/Modules/Functions/SQL) and [here](/Modules/Functions/Template).
- It is no longer necessary to pass random values for generated fields in `INSERT` and `UPDATE` operations. The Query Engine now identifies and handles these fields automatically before executing the final command.
- Fixed an issue that prevented the use of non-generated fields as filters with subqueries.
- Updated embedded web console to reflect the above-mentioned changes.
- Official images were renamed to `kubling/kubling-ce` and `kubling/kubling-cli`.

- Implemented first-class Document functions. [See here.](/Engine/queries#document-functions-)
- Engine Stream Buffer can now use local disk. See the `buffer` configuration option in the [main application configuration](/schemas#main-application-configuration).
- Updated embedded web console to reflect the above-mentioned changes.

## v24.5.2
- Added `blankNamespaceStrategy` option to the Kubernetes Data Source Configuration.
- Added a new aggregator schema button in the console, under Virtual Databases.
- Fixed the JavaScript filesystem cache, which in some circumstances resulted in a false cache miss when the resource had been visited before, especially during `import`.
- Added `metadata__uid` in all deployment related `TABLE`, in the built-in Kubernetes DDL
