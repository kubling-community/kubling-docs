# Product changelog

## v24.5.5
- Introduced a new system schema called `SYSMETRICS`, which includes a table named `METRICS` for retrieving the engine's metrics values.
- Removed the metric `kubling.engine.sql.plan.enqueued_time.max` and replaced it with `kubling.engine.sql.plan.enqueued.max`.

## v24.5.4
- Implemented the distinction between `passthrough` and regular access in Database data sources. Therefore, you can now extend schemas also in these type of data sources. [Learn more](/Engine/ds/db-data-sources).
- Added support for parameter lists in SQL functions.
- Updated function module loading (SQL and Template) to support multiple modules instead of a single one. Changes to naming resolution were introduced; read more [here](/Modules/Functions/SQL) and [here](/Modules/Functions/Template).
- It is no longer necessary to pass random values for generated fields in `INSERT` and `UPDATE` operations. The Query Engine now identifies and handles these fields automatically before executing the final command.
- Fixed an issue that prevented the use of non-generated fields as filters with subqueries.
- Updated embedded web console to reflect the above-mentioned changes.
- Official images were renamed to `kubling/kubling-ce` and `kubling/kubling-cli`.

## v24.5.3
- Implemented Cache. [See here.](/Engine/cache)
- Added metrics to monitor Cache. [See here.](/Observability/metrics#cache-related-metrics-)
- Implemented first-class Document functions. [See here.](/Engine/queries#document-functions-)
- Engine Stream Buffer can now use local disk. See the `buffer` configuration option in the [main application configuration](/schemas#main-application-configuration).
- Updated embedded web console to reflect the above-mentioned changes.

## v24.5.2
- Added `blankNamespaceStrategy` option to the Kubernetes Data Source Configuration.
- Added a new aggregator schema button in the console, under Virtual Databases.
- Fixed the JavaScript filesystem cache, which in some circumstances resulted in a false cache miss when the resource had been visited before, especially during `import`.
- Added `metadata__uid` in all deployment related `TABLE`, in the built-in Kubernetes DDL
