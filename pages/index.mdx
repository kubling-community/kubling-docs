# Welcome to Kubling

Kubling is a federated, SQL-based engine designed to reason over operational state across heterogeneous systems, platforms, and environments.

It enables teams to query, interpret, evaluate, and safely mutate live operational state consistently, 
even when that state spans databases, APIs, infrastructure, workflows, and industrial systems — without introducing a centralized control plane or data ingestion pipeline.

## What Kubling is designed for

Kubling is built for on-prem, cloud, hybrid, and edge environments, where locality, responsibility boundaries, and system heterogeneity matter.

It operates close to the source, federating operational data in place and exposing it through a unified, schema-based interface that behaves consistently across environments.

## The problem it addresses

Modern operations are no longer limited by lack of visibility.  
They are limited by the difficulty of coordinating decisions across systems.

Kubling addresses this by making operational state explicit and queryable as a whole — allowing decisions to be evaluated in context, rather than inferred from disconnected signals.

## How it works (at a high level)

At its core, Kubling uses SQL as a unifying operational language, combined with a strongly typed, schema-first model.

Kubling provides native connectors for a wide range of systems, including relational and NoSQL databases, infrastructure platforms, industrial protocols, and other Kubling instances — enabling true federation and the construction of operational graphs across domains.

For API-based or document-oriented systems, Kubling allows clients to define lightweight data source translators using JavaScript.  
These injected modules treat APIs as first-class data sources, making it possible to model, query, and operate on them with the same semantics as structured systems.

Across both native connectors and injected modules, the engine preserves transactional consistency, isolation, and clear operational semantics.

## What Kubling is not

Kubling is not a data warehouse or an analytics platform.

It is designed to operate directly on live operational systems, focusing on correctness, coordination, and decision evaluation rather than reporting or post-hoc analysis.

## Where Kubling fits best

Kubling is a good fit for teams building or operating:

- Operational platforms and internal tooling
- Workflow-driven systems and orchestrators
- Industrial, infrastructure, or hybrid environments
- AI-assisted operational systems that require precise, governed actions
