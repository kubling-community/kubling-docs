# Environment Variables
Certain parts of the engine are configured before reading the application configuration file, and therefore are set via environment variables.

## Engine level

### `com.kubling.maxStringLength`
By default, the `string` data type has a limit of 4,000 characters. However, you can increase this limit by setting the desired value in this environment variable.

## Application level

### `APP_CONFIG`
The path to the application configuration YAML file.

### `ENABLE_WEB_CONSOLE`
Specifies whether the web console endpoint is activated. This also enables the restart endpoint.

### `SCRIPT_LOG_LEVEL`
Specifies the log level for messages from scripts to be printed.

### `MAX_HTTP_THREAD_POOL_SIZE`
Specifies the maximum number of threads in the HTTP thread pool.

### `MAX_HTTP_WAITING_QUEUE_CAPACITY`
Specifies the maximum capacity of the waiting queue for HTTP requests.


### `KBL_SKIP_ENV_VAR_TEMP_FILE_ENCRYPTION`
Indicates whether the encryption of environment variables saved to disk (used for restarting the engine) should be skipped.
When encryption is **not skipped**, and the container is stopped and restarted, the random key manager generates a new key. 
This new key cannot decrypt the file created during the previous run, causing issues with the restart process.

### `INST_AZ_MON_ACTIVE` and `INST_AZ_MON_KEY` <Tag bgColor={"bg-kubling-dark-violet"} txtColor={"text-white"} description={"DEPRECATED"} txtFont={"font-gilroyBold"} />  <Tag bgColor={"bg-kubling-green"} txtColor={"text-white"} description={"Marked for removal"} txtFont={"font-gilroyBold"} />
Variables related to Azure monitoring, enabling the feature and providing the necessary key.
