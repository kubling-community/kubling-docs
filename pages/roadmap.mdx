# Product roadmap
Adopting a new technology, especially foundational software like a database engine—even a virtual one like Kubling—is a long process that involves some degree of uncertainty.

As developers and DevOps professionals, one thing we often value, but don't always have, is a clear idea of where the products we rely on are heading. 
This is why we’re sharing our high-level roadmap with you.

Please keep in mind that we only list features here that might directly impact you, and not all of them will necessarily be implemented.

## Create a new GraphQL Data Source <Tag bgColor={"bg-kubling-green"} txtColor={"text-white"} description={"Analysis"} txtFont={"font-gilroyBold"} /> <Tag bgColor={"bg-kubling-dark-violet"} txtColor={"text-white"} description={"High Prio"} txtFont={"font-gilroyBold"} />
We are currently developing a new Data Source for GraphQL, which is expected to make a significant impact. 
Many of the existing Script modules that do not require manual interception will likely be transitioned to GraphQL. 
Since the new Data Source will be statically compiled, it will offer performance comparable to that of the Kubernetes Data Source, ensuring both efficiency and scalability.

**Nov-24 Update:** Initial tests revealed the complexity of creating a GraphQL Data Source, as APIs do not typically adhere to a standard for schema generation, 
complicating query formation. We will soon decide whether to continue with this approach or to let users implement it within Script Modules.

## Support for ElasticSearch Data Source <Tag bgColor={"bg-kubling-green"} txtColor={"text-white"} description={"Analysis"} txtFont={"font-gilroyBold"} />
We are currently evaluating the feasibility of supporting ElasticSearch as a data source without importing specific client libraries, in order to avoid increasing the binary size.

## File Logs <Tag bgColor={"bg-kubling-dark-violet"} txtColor={"text-white"} description={"High Prio"} txtFont={"font-gilroyBold"} />
We plan to support saving logs in files, with the ability to define some rolling strategy.

## Log Routers <Tag bgColor={"bg-kubling-green"} txtColor={"text-white"} description={"Implemented"} txtFont={"font-gilroyBold"} />
We are analyzing whether to support routing logs, based on a predefined criteria, to custom script functions.

## Transaction support on `SCRIPT_DOCUMENT_JS` and `KUBERNETES` Data Sources <Tag bgColor={"bg-kubling-green"} txtColor={"text-white"} description={"Analysis"} txtFont={"font-gilroyBold"} />
We are analyzing whether it is possible to implement transactions without breaking these DS principles.

## SQL functions defined in modules
Currently, SQL functions are [defined in specific modules](/Modules/Functions/SQL), forcing to have everything centralized. We plan to support defining SQL functions also
in [Script Bundle Modules](/Modules/DataSource/Script).

## Smaller `kdv` CLI
We'll release a smaller version of the CLI without the `test` command, which requires lots of libraries to be added to the utility.

## Load DDL from modules in Integration tests <Tag bgColor={"bg-kubling-green"} txtColor={"text-white"} description={"Analysis"} txtFont={"font-gilroyBold"} />
Loading DDL files defined inside modules is not yet supported. We are currently analyzing whether the integration tests should read the internal module metadata, 
or if the `ddlFilePath` property should support schemes like `module:` and/or `bundle:`.

## Upgrade Hibernate dialect to version 7 <Tag bgColor={"bg-kubling-dark-violet"} txtColor={"text-white"} description={"Low Prio"} txtFont={"font-gilroyBold"} />
We currently support up to version `6.1.7`, and we are planning to jump directly to version `7`.

## Support Couchbase Data Source <Tag bgColor={"bg-kubling-green"} txtColor={"text-white"} description={"Implemented"} txtFont={"font-gilroyBold"} /> <Tag bgColor={"bg-kubling-dark-violet"} txtColor={"text-white"} description={"Low Prio"} txtFont={"font-gilroyBold"} />
We will support Couchbase, possibly with some limitations, in ~~the next~~ a future release.

## Support Cassandra Data Source <Tag bgColor={"bg-kubling-green"} txtColor={"text-white"} description={"Implemented"} txtFont={"font-gilroyBold"} /> <Tag bgColor={"bg-kubling-dark-violet"} txtColor={"text-white"} description={"Low Prio"} txtFont={"font-gilroyBold"} />
We will support Cassandra, possibly with some limitations, in ~~the next~~ a future release.
