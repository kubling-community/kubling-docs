# HTTP Security <Tag description={"v25.5+"} />

In addition to the native transport used to connect to the Query Engine, Kubling also exposes several HTTP-based endpoints â€” from [metrics](/observability/metrics) to [custom endpoints](/engine/ep/intro).

These HTTP endpoints can also be secured with TLS by configuring a certificate at the [application level](/schemas#main-application-configuration):

```yaml
http:
  tls:
    storeFilePath: "/certs/server-http.ks"
    storePassword: "myhttpserverpass"
```

If clients need to verify the server certificate, be sure to generate the proper trust pair.
We recommend using the [Kubling CLI](/cli/overview#-create-http), which simplifies the process and produces certificates ready to be used in both the server and clients.
