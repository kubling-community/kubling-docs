# Multicluster Kubernetes Dashboard

This Dashboard demonstrates how to monitor multiple Kubernetes clusters in an aggregated manner using logic in queries to extract relevant information and present it in simplified tables.

<Steps>

### Clone our Samples Repository

```shell copy
git clone https://github.com/kubling-community/kubling-dashboard-examples.git
```

### Navigate to the Example Directory
```shell copy
cd k8s-multicluster-metrics
```

### Kubernetes Configuration

- Edit the file `kube_cluster_1.yaml` and add the [kubeconfig content](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/).
- Repeat this process for `kube_cluster_2.yaml` if you have additional clusters to configure.
- To add more clusters, create additional files like `kube_cluster_[n].yaml` and configure them accordingly.

### VDB Configuration
- Open `descriptor/vdb/DashboardVDB.yaml` and ensure the list of `KUBERNETES` data sources matches the configuration files edited or created in the previous step.

### Run it!

```shell copy
sh run-compose.sh
```

### Superset
[Go to the console](http://localhost:8088 "target=_blank")

### Login
Use `admin`/`admin` to log into Superset.

### Open Pre-Configured Dashboards
- In the top menu, click on `Dashboards` and select `Kubernetes Monitoring` to view the current clusters' statuses.
- Alternatively, select `Kubernetes Time Series` to view two simple time series charts showing the historical data of reserved CPU cores and memory.
